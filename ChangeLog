    Don't assume macOS version numbers are of the form 10.N.
    
    Big Sur goes to 11, and it appears that next year's (San Juan Capistrano?)
    will go to 12, and so on.
    
    Split version numbers into major and minor, and do version-number
    comparison (alas, whilst CMake has that built in, the Bourne shell
    doesn't, and neither does the Bourne-again shell).
    
    This should fix issue #17043.

    macos-setup: more cleanups.
    
    Fix/update/expand some comments.
    
    Do uninstalls for dependencies using CMake more similarly.
    
    For LZ4, as it comes with a Makefile rather than any
    autotools/CMake/etc. configuration, "make distclean" might not be
    necessary, so, as it's not supported, just do "make clean".
    
    For libssh, do all removes in the uninstall in a single command, and use
    $DO_RM, so that it uses sudo iff /usr/local isn't writable by us.  In
    addition, remove the build directory as the equivalent of "make
    distclean".
    
    As with libssh, so with brotli.

    FC: use ETHERTYPE_UNK when applicable, no excuses
    
    Two interlocking problems cause the dissection of FC to fail in some cases,
    as shown in the capture of the related issue.
    
    The FC dissector assumes that ETHERTYPE_UNK in the data structure passed
    to it is coming from the MDS header dissector only, and thus that header
    sizes have to be taken into account. This is not / no longer the case.
    It always passes down ETHERTYPE_FCFT. Therefore the MDS header size
    checking does not apply to ETHERTYP_UNK, so is removed as condition.
    
    The other FC related dissectors were forced to setup a data structure to
    pass to FC for it to handle that part of the frame. Because these weren't
    related to ethernet, these lazily set the ethertype field in the data
    structure to 0. This unfortunately matches ETHERTYPE_UNK, triggering the
    MDS header size checking in FC, leading to this issue. With the first
    problem resolved, now make it explicit that unknown ethertype is indicated
    by ETHERTYPE_UNK, not '0'.
    
    Addresses primary part of issue #17084

    SNMP: Fix checking of SNMP v3 auth if MD5 method is used
    
    When the user enters row to SNMP Users table in wireshark and Authentication model is set to MD5, row is ignored in processing. The reason is that constant for MD5 is 0, but the code checks if the value is defined by simple 'usm_p.user_assoc' condition. Therefore 0 never succeeds.
    As item can have only listed values, I think the check can be removed.
    Function verified on sample.
    
    I propose to cherry pick the change to all stable branches.
