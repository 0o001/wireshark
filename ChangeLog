commit aecbbb6000
Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Sun Aug 12 17:23:28 2018 +0200

    HTTP: really choose the correct server port for tunnels
    
    The very first message after a 200 OK response to a CONNECT request
    likely originates from the client. So assume that this destination is
    actually the server.
    
    This reduces the probability of address and port collisions. Previously
    the proxy port (e.g. 3128) and server port (443) identified each
    conversation, now it will use the client and server port instead.

    Clean up temporary filename generation.
    
    Don't put identical code in both arms of a conditional - move it out of
    the conditional.
    
    Doing that with one line of code means that the conditional is now
    *itself* duplicated in both arms of a conditional, so move it out, too.

    HTTP: set correct server port for tunnels
    
    The server port must be set or else http_payload_subdissector will
    assume two independent flows originating from the client. For example,
    client 50813 connects through proxy server 3128 to server 443.
    Previously it would result in three conversations: 50813<->3128 (proxy),
    50813->443, 3128->443. Now it will see 50813<->3128 and 3128<->443 and
    TLS decryption will work again.

    Extcap programs must write to the packet pipe in binary mode.
    
    It doesn't matter on UN*X, but it definitely matters on Windows; we're
    writing a pcap file, not a text file, so every byte we write should go
    down the pipe as is.
