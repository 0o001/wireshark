    gtk: fix compilation with GTK+ before 2.18
    
    Removed in v1.99.2rc0-399-g43f09e6, but some includes are still needed.
    
    Basically I looked for the functions defined in the
    ui/gtk/old-gtk-compat.h header file that were in files below ui/gtk/.
    Then I matched it against the removed part in the above commit and added
    the header back at its old place. In two other cases, the header was
    only needed for Windows.
    
    If the above commit did not reference the file, I checked which function
    was in use and added the header on top, removing redundant conditionals.
    
    Reported and tested by a user of GTK+ 2.12.12 on top of v2.0.5.

    pcapng: do not leak blocks
    
    pcapng_open and pcapng_read have 'wblock' allocated on the stack, so if
    they return, they do not have to set wblock.block to NULL.
    
    pcapng_read_block always sets wblock->block to NULL and may initialize
    it for SHB, IDB, NRB and ISB. Be sure to release the memory for IDB and
    ISB. It is better to have more wtap_block_free calls on a NULL value
    than missing them as this would be a memleak (on the other hand, do not
    release memory that is stored elsewhere such as SHB and NRB).
