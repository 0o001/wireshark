    HTTP: really choose the correct server port for tunnels
    
    The very first message after a 200 OK response to a CONNECT request
    likely originates from the client. So assume that this destination is
    actually the server.
    
    This reduces the probability of address and port collisions. Previously
    the proxy port (e.g. 3128) and server port (443) identified each
    conversation, now it will use the client and server port instead.

    More interface view cleanups.
    
    Rename some of the columns - IFTREE_COL_NAME is the interface name,
    IFTREE_COL_DESCRIPTION is the description/friendly name, and a new
    IFTREE_COL_DISPLAY_NAME column is the display name (which may include
    both the description and the interface name).  Rename
    IFTREE_COL_INTERFACE_COMMENT to just IFTREE_COL_COMMENT - there's no
    *other* type of comment, and "IF" is short for "interface".
    
    In the interface frame, use IFTREE_COL_DISPLAY_NAME, as that's the only
    column that shows both and thus has something for all interfaces.
    
    In the "Manage interfaces" dialog, put the description before the
    interface name, as it was in earlier versions.

    Fix the "Manage interfaces" dialog columns.
    
    Windows is not the only OS with "friendly" names for interfaces; macOS

    well.
    
    The column headings for the "Interface Name" and the "Friendly Name"
    were backwards.

Date:   Fri Aug 10 19:08:40 2018 -0700

    Add support for reading and writing the new if_hardware IDB option.
    
    Support for writing it in live captures will come later; this change,
    but not that one, will be backported so older versions of Wireshark
    won't remove it when writing a file out.

commit 278bb2267c
Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Thu Aug 9 16:51:55 2018 +0200

    HTTP: set correct server port for tunnels
    
    The server port must be set or else http_payload_subdissector will
    assume two independent flows originating from the client. For example,
    client 50813 connects through proxy server 3128 to server 443.
    Previously it would result in three conversations: 50813<->3128 (proxy),
    50813->443, 3128->443. Now it will see 50813<->3128 and 3128<->443 and
    TLS decryption will work again.
