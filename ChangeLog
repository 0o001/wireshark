commit 4f00a466cd
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sat Feb 22 20:35:43 2020 -0800

    Use "must" instead of "should" to avoid ambiguity.
    
    As I said in
    
        https://ask.wireshark.org/question/10361/how-to-properly-use-heuristic-dissector-for-tcp/?answer=10363#post-id-10363
    
      "Should" has multiple meanings; there's "Used to indicate obligation,
      duty, or correctness, typically when criticizing someone's actions.", as
      in "I think we should trust our people more", and there's "Used to
      indicate what is probable.", as in "the bus should arrive in a few
      minutes". You're reading it in the latter sense; it was intended in the
      former sense.
    
      That sentence should probably be changed to "Wireshark must be then set
      up..." to avoid the ambiguity.
    
    Make it so (over half a year later, sigh), and change another case where
    "should" is meant in the first sense while we're at it.
