Author: Guy Harris <gharris@sonic.net>
Date:   Thu Jun 18 00:27:31 2020 -0700

    radiotap: make tables that we modify automatic rather than static.
    
    The arrays of pointers to header field hf_ values were getting
    overwritten if the fields in question are unknown; that meant that, in
    all future dissections, they would be dissected as unknown *even for
    packets where they are known*.
    
    Make them auto arrays, instead, so that each call to the dissector has
    its own copy, properly initialized at run time, that it can scribble
    over as it chooses without damaging the array for the next call.
    
    This involves a cast to work around the type of the array argument being
    "const int **", which means "pointer to pointer to const int",
    not "pointer to const pointer to (non-const) int".  That meant that the
    scribbling on the static array was *not* detected at compile time.
    
    Fixing the type is a *lot* of work, but may catch other instances of
    this problem, and may prevent future instances of it.  That's a project
    for a separate commit, however.

    GSM RR: Fix wrong expert warning about missing P1 Rest Octets
    
    3GPP TS 04.08 sec 9.1.22 "Paging request type 1" states that "P1 Rest
    Octets" is (M)andatory, but then in the same table states its length
    ranges from 0 to 17, which means it can actually be missing on some
    cases:
    "The sum of the length of this IE and the L2 Pseudo Length of the
    message equals 22."
    
    So that happens (l2 plen = 22) for instance when 2 IMSIs are provided in
    a Paging Request Type 1 message. In that case, we shouldn't be warning
    about the packet being malformed having the IE missing, since it's
    actually expected.
    
    The l2 Pseudo Length is shifter 2 bits because that's how it's defined
    in the spec (sec 10.5.2.19).
