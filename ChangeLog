    Qt: Check for NULL pointer in profile->reference
    
    Check for NULL pointer before using profile->reference in strcmp()
    because this will give a crash. Doing a copy profile from a new profile
    will set the reference to NULL in get_profile_parent().
    
    Use an unambiguously profile reference value NULL as profile->reference
    when creating a new profile to align with when copy from a new profile.

    Libpcap may now say "The interface disappeared" if it did.
    
    A recent change to libpcap means that the error message if an interface
    disappears (e.g., removing a hot-pluggable device, or shutting down a
    PPP connection that was dynamically set up) is "The interface
    disappeared" rather than "The interface went down" - on FreeBSD,
    DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD, and Darwin-based OSes, capturing continues with
    no error if the interface is configured down, but either ENXIO or EIO
    (depending on the OS) is delivered if the interface disappears.
    
    Treat that error as another one to show the user without the "report
    this to the Wireshark developers" note.

    Fixes the following Lintian 2.15.0 (Debian sid) warnings with WS 3.0.2:
    
        W: wireshark-common: extended-description-line-too-long
        W: wireshark-common: command-with-path-in-maintainer-script postrm:11 /usr/sbin/delgroup

    Replace absolute path test in postrm and fix indentation.
    
    Remove the Priority line in binary packages since they default to the
    Source priority which is set to "optional". See

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Jun 4 14:44:19 2019 -0700

    Fix the dissection of create temporary file responses.
    
    According to MS-CIFS:
    
            1) the file name is not one of those "buffer format followed by
               a string" fields, it's just a string, so there's no buffer
               format field;
    
            2) it's always in ASCII, so ignore the "Unicode strings" flag.
    
    Note that, for the *request*, the *directory* name isn't claimed to
    always be ASCII, so honor the "Unicode strings" flag there.

Date:   Thu May 30 21:18:19 2019 +0200

    btle: Correctly detect l2cap fragment start
    
    The first L2CAP PDU fragment starts with the 4 octet long L2CAP header
    consisting of the Length and the CID fields. The Length field doesn't
    include the header itself. Thus the Length field in the BLE Data header
    will be 4 octets larger than the L2CAP PDU header Length field if the
    packet wouldn't be fragmented.
    
    The current implementation doesn't correctly detect the start fragment
    causing reassembly to fail as it compares the BLE Data Length with the
    L2CAP Length without compensating for the header.
    
    By increasing the L2CAP PDU Length field with the header length the
    reassembly works.
    
    Rename the variable to better reflect what length it actually
    represents.

Date:   Fri May 24 10:45:07 2019 +0200

    iso14443: use the correct I-block payload
    
    When we reassemble I-blocks, we pass the payload to fragment_add_seq_next.
    To do so, we use the overall iso14443 tvb, an offset and the payload length
    as parameters.
    
    We then call process_reassembled_data to do reassembly. If the I-block was
    not fragmented, process_reassembled_data returns the only fragment + the
    rest of the packet after this fragment.
    
    This might be a misunderstanding on my part or something to be fixed in the
    reassembly routines. For now, we work around this by defining a new tvb for
    the data we submit to fragment_add_seq_next.
    
    (I ran into a similar issue years ago for DVB-CI. Add a comment about this.
    If it turns out that there's a better way to fix this, we should be fixing
    both dissectors.)

    Fix handling of headers in body part.

    characters, not whether the full header does - the full header may
    include LWSP, which includes HT, CR, and LF, none of which are
    considered "printable", so valid headers were being treated as not being
    headers, causing mis-dissection of some packets.
    
    We don't need to split the header name from the value -
    is_known_multipart_header() stops comparison at the end of the header
    name.

    Clean up some ASCII vs. EBCDIC string handling.
    
    In at least one capture, structure IDs are in ASCII even though the code
    page in the header is an EBCDIC code page.  Determine the structure ID's
    character encoding based on whether it's the ASCII or EBCDIC version of
    the ID value, not on the global character encoding.
    
    We were using the *integer* encoding, not the *string* encoding, for the
    "qprotect" field, which is a string; fix that.
    
    Use STR_UNICODE for strings, as they're not guaranteed to consist of
    characters that can be mapped to ASCII characters (even the common
    subset of EBCDIC, not counting code page-dependent code points, has
    non-ASCII printable characters in it).

    SDP: show rtcp and rtcp-mux media attribute values
    
    With the addition of handling the rtcp and rtpc-mux media attributes
    (see cde023c3c5a08131495eb2574c00ff1f34cdce55) the default behaviour
    of presenting the media attribute value itself was lost. This change
    adds this back.

    DPNSS: dissect Service Indicator Code synch/asynch info
    
    The DPNSS specification for the Service Indicator Code
    Synch/Asynchronous Information field states that the lower three bits of
    this field define the Data Type. This requires a filter of three bits,
    in this case 0x7, instead of 0x3 which is two bits.
