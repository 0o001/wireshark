Author: Guy Harris <gharris@sonic.net>
Date:   Wed Sep 23 02:57:52 2020 +0000

    ncp: fix handling of NDS List requests and replies.
    
    In requests:
    
    There appear to be 2 bytes of unknown data (typically 0) after the
    2-byte Request Flags field (are they just 2 bytes of additional flags?).
    Skip past them before dissecting the iterator.
    
    If there are no bytes remaining in the packet after the parent ID, stop
    dissecting; some packets seem to stop there.  For those requests, assume
    that the response will contain :
    
            entry ID;
            entry flags;
            subordinate count;
            modification time;
            base class;
            relative distinguished name;
    
    although the last of those might be something else (it appears to be of
    the form "CN={name}").
    
    In replies:
    
    For each returned entry, if the requested field flags in the request had
    the DSI_OUTPUT_FIELDS bit set, fetch the returned field flags and use
    that to determine what fields are present; otherwise, use the requested
    field flags.

commit 77156947c4
Author: Guy Harris <gharris@sonic.net>
Date:   Tue Sep 22 17:47:43 2020 +0000

    ncp: fix setting elements of an ncp_record structure.
    
    In dissect_nds_request():
    
    Fill in fieds of the ncp_record structure only on the first pass; once
    the first pass is complete, the structure's fully filled in.
    
    That fixes cases where NDS replies aren't fully dissected because the
    NDS verb isn't added to the ncp_record structure when the request is
    dissected.
    
    Fill in elements as soon as we have the value needed to fill it in, so
    that it's filled in even if we throw an exception later, and so that
    it's filled in only if we have the value in the packet, so that a valid
    value isn't overwritten by a later packet that doesn't have the value.
    
    This fixes cases where, in the second pass, NDS replies aren't fully
    dissected because the NDS verb is overwritten in the ncp_record
    structure when a continuation of the request is dissected.
    
    Note that we should perhaps make the object_name field a pointer to a
    wmem-allocated string, so that NULL can indicate "not set, hence not
    known".

    ncp: fix a copy-and-pasteo.
    
    In process_multivalues(), we create a protocol item for the attribute
    syntax, but we don't fetch its value, and don't pass it to
    print_nds_values() as the syntax argument; instead, we pass a variable
    that wee initialize to 0, but never set.  (One of the disadvantages of
    preemptively initializing local variables is that data flow analyzers in
    compilers and static analyzers can't point out that you didn't set the
    variables in question to *useful* values.)
    
    This fixes the dissection of NDS Read replies.

    Commits in release branches are typically cherry-picked from master,
    which means that:
    
    - We've presumably validated the commit message there.
    
    - The "(cherry picked from commit ..." line that GitLab adds might have
      extra newlines which fail the whitespace check.
    
    cppcheck.sh hasn't had any of the efficiency improvements backported,

    This field is actually a bitmask of four bits.  It's somewhat odd

    TCP: do not use an unknown status when the checksum is 0xffff
    
    Otherwise it triggers an assert when adding the column as the field is
    defined as BASE_NONE and not BASE_DEC or BASE_HEX. Thus an unknown value
    (not in proto_checksum_vals[)array) cannot be represented.
    Mark the checksum as bad even if we process the packet.
    Closes #16816

    PROFINET: DHCP suboption undefined bytes
    
    There are undefined bytes which must be included in DHCP
    suboption block according to DCP Block Length. In other
    words, there are still bytes after dissection of defined
    parameters finish but DCP block length does not finish.
    In order to solve the problem, these bytes are included in
    DHCP suboption block and marked Undefined. The byte number
    can be 1, so bytes word in pn_user_data is changed to byte.
