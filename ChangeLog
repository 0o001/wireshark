commit 670ebda
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Oct 6 18:00:57 2014 -0700

    Add some higher-level file-read APIs and use them.
    
    Add wtap_read_bytes(), which takes a FILE_T, a pointer, a byte count, an
    error number pointer, and an error string pointer as arguments, and that
    treats a short read of any sort, including a read that returns 0 bytes,
    as a WTAP_ERR_SHORT_READ error, and that returns the error number and
    string through its last two arguments.
    
    Add wtap_read_bytes_or_eof(), which is similar, but that treats a read
    that returns 0 bytes as an EOF, supplying an error number of 0 as an EOF
    indication.
    
    Use those in file readers; that simplifies the code and makes it less
    likely that somebody will fail to supply the error number and error
    string on a file read error.

    Dissectors that need this set break badly when it isn't. Dissectors which don't
    need this set will still generally be understandable without it, since e.g.
    retransmissions will link to the original packet at the TCP layer, and
    presumably the subdissector payload is exactly the same in that case.

    Qt: Keep dialogs from blocking tests.
    
    If WIRESHARK_QUIT_AFTER_CAPTURE is set, call exit(0). This keeps us from
    emitting the aboutToQuit signal and doing things that might pop up
    dialogs.

    Some Release Notes cleanup.
    
    - Don't list bugs which were fixed in 1.12 as being fixed in 1.99. (We probably
      should add some bugs to the bugs-fixed list.)
    - Remove new-features list for everything prior to 1.12 (so we only list
      improvements since 1.12).
    - Fix bug link to bug 1814.
    - Fix the wiki's URL (the wiki doesn't appear to support https today).
    - Remove bugs 4445 and 9242 from the Known Problems list: they've been fixed.

    http: ignore response body for HEAD requests
    
    Responses to HEAD requests must not have a message body, so do not
    attempt to use the Content-Length and similar headers that indicate a
    non-empty message body in the response. Those point to the entity that
    would be returned for non-HEAD requests.
    
    Requests do not have request_method set, so do not limit desegmentation
    by HEAD in that case. Verified by comparing the output of `tshark -O
    http` and by looking in the Wireshark GTK UI.

    cmake: update FindGTK2 to v3.0.1-1824-g0b12815
    
    Current FindGTK2.cmake as included with Wireshark cannot do a 32-bit
    build even after setting CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib32. After an update
    to upstream FindGTK2 (v3.0.1-1824-g0b12815), things build again.
    
    Compared to upstream FindGTK2, FindWSWinLibs and related hints have been
    added (note that "${GTK2_HINTS}/lib" is not a typo, it is needed as some
    headers are includes in locations like lib/gtk-2.0/include/). The
    include paths have become relative again as there are no files like
    FindPackageHandleStandardArgs in the Wireshark source tree. Diff between
    upstream FindGTK2 and the version in this patch:

commit 9506909
Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Thu Sep 25 12:09:23 2014 +0200

    cmake: use pkg-config for resolving dependencies
    
    Changes:
     * Fix glib2 search path.
     * Add pkg-config support to CAP, GEOIP, GNUTLS, LUA, PortAudio (API
       19), zlib, kerberos.
     * Add pkg-config support to libnl3, libnl2 and libnl1 (but tested only
       with libnl3).
    
    This makes it easier to do 32-bit builds on 64-bit hosts by just setting
    `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR`. Due to how HINTS work, it is still fragile though:
    missing 32-bit libraries will cause a fallback to 64-bit libraries.
    
    A future patch could check for `<PREFIX>_FOUND` and remove the manual
    `find_path` and `find_library` hackery since the paths are already
    known.

    GTK+: Revert back to 2.24.14-1.1 on Win64.
    
    As Pascal discovered in
    
    https://www.wireshark.org/lists/wireshark-dev/201409/msg00045.html
    
    Wireshark-gtk.exe crashes at startup on Windows 8.1 x64 when compiled
    with the GTK+ 2.24.23-1.1 bundle and Visual C++ 2013. Revert to the
    Win64 build to the prior GTK+ bundle, which works on my test system.
    
    Update the release notes. Make sure we use a libintl-8.dll that's
    compatible with GnuTLS.
    
    Ideally we'd just upgrade or rebuild the GTK+ bundle but so far that
    hasn't worked. Prior to this I tried:
    
    Updating the gtk2 package at build.opensuse.org to 2.24.24. This fails with
    
    [  187s] make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/gtk+-2.24.24/gtk'

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Sep 28 16:28:36 2014 -0700

    Add support for getting nanosecond time stamp resolution when capturing.
    
    If we have pcap_set_tstamp_precision(), use it to request nanosecond
    time stamp resolution *if* we're writing a pcap-ng file; any code that
    reads those files and can't handle nanosecond time stamp resolution is
    broken and needs to be fixed.
    
    If we're writing a pcap file, don't ask for nanosecond resolution time
    stamps, as that requires a different magic number for pcap files, and
    not all code that reads pcap files can handle that.  (Unlike pcap-ng,
    where the ability to have non-microsecond time stamp resolution was
    present from Day One, it's a relatively recent addition to pcap.)  We
    could add a command-line option/GUI option for that, like the option
    recent versions of tcpdump have, if it matters.

    Make the time stamp resolution per-packet.

    types of "unknown" and "per-packet", add the time stamp resolution to
    struct wtap_pkthdr, have the libwiretap core initialize it to the
    per-file time stamp resolution, and have pcap-ng do the same thing with
    the resolution that it does with the packet encapsulation.
    
    Get rid of the TS_PREC_AUTO_XXX values; just have TS_PREC_AUTO, which
    means "use the packet's resolution to determine how many significant
    digits to display".  Rename all the WTAP_FILE_TSPREC_XXX values to
    WTAP_TSPREC_XXX, as they're also used for per-packet values.

    Don't change the packet list column precision in taps.
    
    The only place where the packet list column precision should be set is
    in the code for the column precision menu item, the code for the recent
    file item for that precision, and, if we were to provide it, code for a
    command-line optpion to set it.  It's not up to some tap to change it.

    The length of the pktap header isn't fixed, it's a field in the header.
    
    Don't assume that, once we've dissected the fields in the header we know
    about and skipped past them, that the payload follows immediately
    afterwards; use the header length from the header to find the payload.

    Qt: Re-enable menu icons.
    
    The GNOME HIG says "Where a corresponding toolbar icon exists, a menu

    should use them for common or familiar actions but otherwise avoid
    clutter. I think icons in the "File" menu look like crap. Try to strike
    a balance.
    
    Use the 16x16 application icon for both the main web site and the wiki
    since that's the favicon used on both sites.
    
    Assume that "Reload" isn't used very often and remove it from the
    toolbar.

    In addition, both EOF *and* a short read, in that routine, should be

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Sep 22 03:47:24 2014 -0700

    Clean up reading code.
    
    The only place where a short read should be treated as an EOF is if the
    read of the block header reads 0 bytes.  All other short reads,
    including reads of the block header returning at least 1 byte but not
    enough for a complete block header, and any reads of the stuff
    *following* the block header even if they return 0 bytes, should be
    treated as "short read" errors.
    
    If the option length is bigger than the option buffer size, treat that
    as a bad file (I'm not sure that can happen, so maybe it should be
    treated as an internal error instead).
    
    Use file_skip() rather than file_seek() when skipping forward N bytes.
    If it fails, treat that as an error under all circumstances.
    
    When reading the first section header block in the open routine, have
    pcap_read_block() return -2 if it doesn't look like an SHB (too short,
    wrong block type, bad block length, unknown byte-order magic number), as
    that means the file isn't a pcap-ng file and the open should return 0.
    
    Return -1, not 0, for all errors in various block-reading routines.
    
    file_seek() returning 0 is *not* an error.  file_seek() returning -1 (or
    any other negative number *is* an error; its return value is signed, so
    don't assign it to an unsigned variable.
    
    This might fix the test errors for the Lua file format handler tests.

    them with the QIcon::On state.
    
    Make the plain versions of x-capture-start blue to match the general

    when Wireshark is "at rest" and green when it's capturing.

Author: Gerald Combs <gerald@wireshark.org>
Date:   Thu Sep 18 14:09:55 2014 -0700

    Qt: Add stock icons.
    
    The new icons are patterned after the existing capture icons. They could
    probably benefit from some adjustments here and there.
    
    Start moving toward icon names and a directory layout compliant with
    freedesktop.org's Icon Naming Specification and Icon Theme
    Specification. We aren't fully compliant and might never be but anyone
    with exposure to FDO icon themes should at least know where everything
    is.
    
    Make Capture Start (x-capture-start) the first icon in the toolbar.
    
    Define the Colorize Packets, Auto Scroll, and zoom icons even though the
    Qt UI doesn't use them yet.
    
    Leave the Capture Filter, Display Filter, Coloring Rules, Preferences,
    and Help icons off for now. The GTK+ toolbar is overly cluttered and I'm
    not sure they're necessary.
    
    Try not to break ui/gtk/toolbar_icons.h.
    
    Remove welcome.qrc. I initially added it in case we needed to overlay
    the welcome screen with translucent .pngs but that never happened.
    
    To do:
    
    - Move the old GTK+ icons to their own directory.
    
    - Find a better name for the "toolbar" directory. "stock"?
    
    - Make the toolbar configurable.

    At the very least this prevents qtshark's default geometry from being saved to
    my recent file and affecting wireshark-gtk's geometry.

    Don't assert that values fit in 32 bits if the NDR64 flag is set.
    
    For now, this just pacifies fuzz-testing.  If real world examples have this, there needs to be a drastic overhaul to support fields that could be either 32 or 64-bit values.

Date:   Tue Aug 26 15:37:00 2014 +0200

    Bluetooth: ACL/AVDTP: Fix ACL session handling
    
    In case like reusing "connection handle" number in next connection
    (2 -> 3 -> 2 again) AVDTP dissector does not properly dissected packets
    (it should be Signal, but dissect as Media).
    
    Add expert error to all packets that are not in ACL connection. This will
    show invalid packages (send after dissconnect), however incomplete
    (mostly beginning) connection will be marked too, but I think it have more
    pros than cons.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Sep 16 14:30:16 2014 -0700

    Use tvb_new_subset_length() rather than tvb_new_subset().
    
    We rarely, if ever, want to, or need to, explicitly set the captured
    length of a packet; we want to set the *reported* length and let the
    tvbuff code figure out how much of that data was actually captured.

    Don't use the captured length as the packet length.
    
    Add a routine ber_tvb_new_subset_length() used to construct tvbuffs for
    parts of the packet, and have it check the specified length against the
    *reported* length.  NOTE: that routine should really take an item and an
    expert info value as arguments and, if the length is greater than the
    remaining packet length, add an expert info for that.
    
    Also, when counting items in a SEQUENCE-OF:
    
    	keep track of whether we succeeded in counting them, and report
    	an "unknown number of items" if we didn't;
    
    	if the length of an item in the SEQUENCE-OF is so big we get an
    	overflow, just bail out of the count loop and indicate that we
    	didn't succeed in counting them - let the error be reported in
    	the process of dissection.

    Don't use the captured length, and don't fetch the version until we need it.
    
    The captured length reflects the way the capture was done; it should not
    affect actual lengths used in the dissection.
    
    Don't fetch the version until we need it; that lets us dissect more of
    the packet if the previous change caused us to throw an exception trying
    to fetch the version from the correct location rather than not throwing
    an exception by fetching it from an incorrect location that happens to
    be within the captured data.

    Treat a length of -1 as a Very Large Length in most cases.
    
    For field types where it doesn't mean "to the end of the tvbuff", treat
    it like other negative length values - as if it were unsigned and thus
    Very Large and thus likely to be past the end of the tvbuff.  That way,
    some of the "we hax0red your SNMP packets" captures, with length fields
    of 0xffffffff, report malformed packets rather than dissector bugs.

    Don't use tvb_bytes_exist() to check if we captured the whole frame, just
    compare captured_length to reported_length (which we've already retrieved
    anyway).
    
    Replace calls to tvb_length() with non-deprecated versions.

    General cleanup of RTP-MIDI dissector.
    
    The biggest changes involved:
    1. Use the "bounds checking" of proto_tree_add_xxx, instead of doing it manually. There are still places where it's done "manually", but they have been drastically reduced.  Someone with more understanding of the protocol/dissector would need to take a look at them.
    2. proto_tree_add_text -> proto_tree_add_subtree[_format]
    3. Use proto_tree_add_bitmask when appropriate.

    Squelch a compiler warning and get rid of an unnecessary variable.
    
    Just use "sizeof line" for the size of that array; don't have a separate
    variable with the number of elements of the array (which at least is
    equal to the size of the array, as it's an array of char), as that means
    that you have to remember to change both of them.
    
    Then cast "sizeof line" to int, as the second argument to fgets() is an
    int, not a size_t (fgets(), as I remember, existed before size_t).

    Try to suppress MSVC++ unused parameter warnings.
    
    I haven't found a way to with MSVC to mark parameters in the argument
    list as unused.  MSVC doesn't give warnings about them in C code, but
    does appear to give them with C++ code.  An answer to
    
    	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3020584/avoid-warning-unreferenced-formal-parameter
    
    suggests not giving the formal parameter a name in C++.
    
    Have a macro UNUSED_PARAMETER(), which takes as an argument a variable
    name, and expands to nothing in C++ and to the variable name followed by
    _U_ in C, and use that for some unused parameters.  If it works, we'll
    use it for all of them.

    CP2179 protocol is a serial based protocol. The 2179 protocol is implemented with minor variations between vendors.

    Check whether the hop-count of most inner message is equal to 0
    
    Extract RFC3315 about relay message and hop-count :
    
    20.1.1. Relaying a Message from a Client
    
       If the relay agent received the message to be relayed from a client,
       the relay agent places a global or site-scoped address with a prefix
       assigned to the link on which the client should be assigned an
       address in the link-address field.  This address will be used by the
       server to determine the link from which the client should be assigned
       an address and other configuration information.  The hop-count in the
       Relay-forward message is set to 0.
    
    20.3. Construction of Relay-reply Messages
    
       A server uses a Relay-reply message to return a response to a client
       if the original message from the client was relayed to the server in
       a Relay-forward message or to send a Reconfigure message to a client
       if the server does not have an address it can use to send the message
       directly to the client.
    
       A response to the client MUST be relayed through the same relay
       agents as the original client message.  The server causes this to
       happen by creating a Relay-reply message that includes a Relay
       Message option containing the message for the next relay agent in the
       return path to the client.  The contained Relay-reply message
       contains another Relay Message option to be sent to the next relay
       agent, and so on.  The server must record the contents of the
       peer-address fields in the received message so it can construct the
       appropriate Relay-reply message carrying the response from the
       server.
    
       For example, if client C sent a message that was relayed by relay
       agent A to relay agent B and then to the server, the server would
       send the following Relay-Reply message to relay agent B:
    
       msg-type:       RELAY-REPLY
       hop-count:      1
       link-address:   0
       peer-address:   A
       Relay Message option, containing:
         msg-type:     RELAY-REPLY
         hop-count:    0
         link-address: address from link to which C is attached
         peer-address: C
         Relay Message option: <response from server>

    Fix PortableApps packaging.
    
    Our Windows portable packaging environment has a lot of cruft which is
    no longer relevant. We removed support for U3 packages and the method
    we use to generate PortableApps packages has been deprecated for a while.
    
    Create PortableApps packages using current file formats (AppInfo v3.0)
    and tools. Generate the PA launcher using the PortableApps.com Launcher
    generator. Copy files and directories from the top level instead of using
    a manifest derived from the NSIS installer.
    
    The manifest is a good idea, but we should create a central manifest
    and use that to generate the NSIS and PortableApps packages instead of
    trying to parse wireshark.nsi.
    
    The new package still needs a bit of work but it installs and runs in
    the current version of the PA Platform.
    
    Remove the define for MAKENSIS_UNICODE. It doesn't look like we were
    using it.
    
    Start tearing down makefiles and scripts that we no longer use.

Date:   Mon Aug 11 16:18:08 2014 -0400

    Simplify ./configure logic for telling rpmbuild which GUI(s) we're building.
    
    Rather than checking for all the "--with" arguments just use the "$have_xxx"
    variables.
    
    Don't allow rpmbuild's ./configure to decide to build a GUI just because it's
    available: make it build only what was ./configure'd.

commit b7fb116
Author: Gerald Combs <gerald@wireshark.org>
Date:   Thu Aug 28 16:48:53 2014 -0700

    Qt → wireshark. GTK+ → wireshark-gtk.
    
    Make sure the Qt UI is named "Wireshark" and its executable is named
    "wireshark" or "wireshark.exe". Make sure the GTK+ UI is named
    "Wireshark 1" or "Wireshark (GTK+)" depending on how much the target
    audience is likely to care about UI toolkits. Make sure the GTK+
    executable is named "wireshark-gtk" or "wireshark-gtk.exe".
    
    It looks like moving to Qt 5.3 (g978faf3) broke the PortableApps
    package. It's likely even more broken now.
    
    Autotools out-of-tree builds also broke on Ubuntu 12.02 (automake
    1.11.3) at some point. The first attempt to compile in ui/qt returns
    "error: source_file.cpp: No such file or directory". The second attempt
    works. Out-of-tree builds work fine on Ubuntu 14.04 (automake 1.14.1).
    
    Tested:
    
    - Nmake builds
    
    - NSIS packaging
    
    - CMake builds (Windows, OS X)
    
    - Autotools build and distcheck
    
    - RPM packaging
    
    To do:
    
    - Test Debian packaging
    
    - Fix PortableApps

    - (Updated) Fixed whitespaces and code review issues
    - Representing now some NTP times as duration (not as date)
    - Added some vendor specific PIDs (RTI)
    - Added dissect_APP_ACK_CONF, dissect_APP_ACK and
      dissect_HEARTBEAT_VIRTUAL
    - Added is_discovery to dissect_serialize_data to avoid malformed
      packets when using mutable types (Wireshark assumes serialized
      data with CDR-PL encapsulation is always discovery data, what
      is not true when using Mutable types)

Author: Gerald Combs <gerald@wireshark.org>
Date:   Thu Aug 14 13:20:09 2014 -0700

    Qt: Rework the "Manage Interfaces" dialog.
    
    Convert QTableWidget to QTreeWidget.
    
    It looks like the GTK+ version has a separate set of apply/save buttons
    for each tab which *only* operates on that tab. This can result unexpected
    behavior which throws away changes if the user updates more than one
    tab. Use a single "OK" button that applies all of our changes instead.
    
    Reorder the tabs. Put Local Interfaces first and select it by default.
    Always show Remote Interfaces. Disable it on platforms that don't have
    PCAP_REMOTE.
    
    Automatically start editing when we add a new pipe. Don't immediately
    update pipe interface settings. Wait until we hit "OK" instead.
    
    Rename NewFileDelegate to PathChooserDelegate. Note that we might want
    to move it use it elsewhere in the application.
    
    Try switching the user-facing terminology from "Hide" to the more
    positive "Show".
    
    Tell the user that we don't save pipe or remote interface settings.
    
    Add a help URL for the "Manage Interfaces" dialog box.
    
    Use the GLib and Qt string functions and classes to split and join
    comma-separated preferences. This makes sure capture_dev_user_descr_find
    doesn't skip over the first interface. It also keeps the Qt code from
    adding a leading comma to our capture preferences.
    
    Add a note about strings to README.qt. Summary: Use QStrings.
    
    For another day:
    
    - If we *do* save remote settings we need to store credentials securely,
      e.g. with CryptProtectData.
    
    - Get rid of the remote settings dialogs. Their controls should fit in the
      remote settings tab.
    
    - Add an extcap tab.
    
    - We need getter/setter functions for global_capture_opts.all_ifaces. We
      iterate over it *way* too much.

    Increase the error buffer size for rpcap.
    
    If the rpcap port is unreachable pcap_findalldevs_ex can write more
    than PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE bytes to errbuf. E.g. if we try to capture from
    Google's all-eights public DNS server we get:
    
    ----
    Can't get list of interfaces: Is the server properly installed on 8.8.8.8?
    connect() failed: A connection attempt failed because the connected
    party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established
    connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.  (code 1
    ----
    
    Set the buffer to PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE*4 bytes. Hopefully that's large enough.

    Use FreeRADIUS's warning pragma controls to suppress Apple complaints.
    
    Apple would really rather that you use their Shiny Happy Frameworks
    rather than those crufty old cross-platform APIs.  We are a
    cross-platform program, and will use platform-specific APIs only if
    there's enough benefit to doing so - and, in this case, that means
    "using the platform-specific APIs on OS X and the other APIs on other
    platforms", so that's two code paths to maintain, so "enough benefit"
    has to outweigh the issues with that.

Date:   Tue Aug 26 10:16:58 2014 -0700

    Exclude MA USB TransferAck's from USB conversation
    
    the usb_trans_info struct only understands Requests & Responses.
    TransferAcks are currently treated as responses, which throws off
    the Request/Response pairing & dissection.
    
    This patch fixes tracking in the case when a TransferAck & TransferReq
    are in the same TCP packet. It does not fix the case where there are
    multiple TransferReq's or TransferResp's in 1 TCP packet.
    
    Eventually I want to revamp usb_trans_info structure to support:
     -multiple requests/responses per transaction (IE: retries)
     -TransferAck tracking
     -handling of multiple requests/responses in 1 TCP packet

    RPKI RTR: Wrong decoding of RPKI RTR End of Data PDU
    
    The decoding of the End of Data PDU ignores the Serial Number, i.e., the last 32 bit of this PDU. Instead of that the current dissector implementation starts to decode a new RTR PDU.
    
    Details of packet format see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6810#section-5.8

    Hack to fix RTP player progress line position
    
    PortAudio seems to return 0 as value for Pa_GetStreamTime() on
    a PulseAudio system using the ALSA host API. This is known for 3 years,
    but still has not been fixed. As this function basically gives us a
    monotonically increasing clock in seconds as double, just use the Glib
    library function for that. I don't know whether this adds much latency,
    but it is certainly better than breaking the progress line (and also
    the related auto-scroll).
    
    While at it, split the idx calculation and explain what each part does
    and add modelines. Remove invalid _U_ annotations.

    Strengthen the heuristics for pcap subtypes.
    
    When trying to guess what type of capture a file is, look for as many
    bogosities (caplen > len, microseconds >= 10^6/nanoseconds >= 10^9,
    too-high caplen, too-high original len, caplen > snapshort length), to
    increase the chances of guessing correctly.
    
    (Every time somebody uses 0xa1b2c3d4 as the magic number for a capture
    file that isn't standard pcap format, God kills a kitten.  Please, think
    of the kittens.)

    packet-infiniband: added support for Mellanox DC transport type
    
    *marked parse_DCCETH() function's unesed parameters with _U_ macro instead of (void) */
    *Added few whitespaces (new lines), were mistakenly removed"*
    
    Adding minimal support for Mellanox DC transport type which
    replaces RD (RD isn't implemented in any HW yet).
    It's minimal in the sense of skipping new headers without
    parsing/showing them, this allows at least to keep correct IB packet parsing
    due to the new added header for this TS. (in this stage we can't expose
    the protocol details including it's header layout)

    Don't assert out on tvb_memcpy() with a null data pointer if the length is 0.
    
    If the length is 0, there's nothing to copy, so it doesn't matter if
    there's no data to copy from.  This fixes problems caused by allocating
    a zero-length buffer and using that as the data for a tvbuff; the
    allocation returns null, so the data pointer is null.

     This implementation seeks for a generic implementation,
     which results in a seamless integration with the current
     system, and does add all external interfaces as simple
     interfaces.
    
     Windows Note: Due to limitations with GTK and Windows,
     a gspawn-winXX-helper.exe, respective gspawn-winXX-helper-console.exe
     is needed, which is part of any GTK windows installation.
    
     The default installation directory from the build is an extcap
     subdirectory underneath the run directory. The folder used by
     extcap may be viewed in the folders tab of the about dialog.
    
     The default installation directory for extcap plugins with
     a pre-build or installer version of wireshark is the extcap
     subdirectory underneath the main wireshark directory.
    
     For more information see:

      bug #9009
    
     Also take a look in doc/extcap_example.py for a Python-example
     and in extcap.pod for the arguments grammer.
    
     Todo:
       - Integrate with Qt - currently no GUI is generated, but
         the interfaces are still usable

Author: Wasim Abu Moch <wasim@mellanox.com>
Date:   Sun Aug 17 15:24:14 2014 +0300

    packet-erf: added dissector table for "erf.types.type" type field.
    
    1- removed unnecessary include <wiretap/erf.h>
    2- used fall through in protocol switch case instead of calling same
    function with same params.
    
    fixes/changes after review with Evan Huus, changes ETH/IPv4/IPv6/Infiniband/InfinibandLink
    to use dissector table instead of direct function calls.
    other protocols should be called in the same way, we'll do it when have
    the time.
    
    instead of calling subdissector directly from packet-erf.c code it's
    easier to declare this and each time we need to register a new
    protocol over erf format we sould easily extend it from the protcol module
    instead using "dissector_add_uint()" function.
    
    the change is still backward compatible, if no upper protocol is
    registered for the specifc type an old fasion direct function call
    is performed.

    9P2000.L also has the UID field in tattach.
    
    See, for example:
    
    	http://code.google.com/p/diod/wiki/protocol#attach,_auth_--_messages_to_establish_a_connection
    
    and
    
    	http://code.google.com/p/diod/wiki/protocol#Overview
    
    where the latter says
    
    	9P2000.L consists of a subset of the canonical 9P2000
    	operations, the 9P2000.u attach and auth messages, plus new
    	operations designed to map to the Linux VFS in a straightforward
    	way.
    
    so tattach and tauth are the same as 9P2000.u.
    
    Don't throw a dissector assertion of there's data at the end of the
    packet; in the particular case that found this bug, yes, it was a
    dissector bug, but it could also be a malformed packet, and we should
    not throw dissector assertions unless we know *for certain* that the
    problem is a dissector bug rather than a malformed packet.

    Various dissection improvements.
    
    In WCCP V2, check whether the length field runs past the end of the
    packet (actual packet data, not captured data) and, if so, report an
    error with expert info, otherwise use the length field to set the length
    of the tvbuff.  That allows the dissector to just use the tvbuff checks
    to do length checks, so eliminate manual length checks.
    
    In find_wccp_address_table(), stop if we run past the reported length or
    packet length; if we fail to find an address table because we run past
    the captured length, we should probably note that if we're trying to
    dissect addresses.
    
    Don't do any other checks against the captured length, just throw the
    BoundsError assertion, to report that the packet was cut short during
    the capture process.
    
    When creating a protocol subtree for an item, give it a "to the end"
    initial length", and only set the length when we're finished dissecting
    the item, based on the amount of data dissected.
    
    Don't speak of dissectors in expert info - the user needn't know what a
    dissector is; what matters is what the protocol specifies.
    
    Properly report "item is too short" errors - those are indicated by item
    dissectors returning a negative value, so show the negative of that
    value.
    
    Make the top level item for a capability element be a separate item from
    the element type; use hf_capability_element_type for the type rather
    than the entire element, and put the type and length into the protocol
    tree in that order, as that's the order in which they appear in the
    packet.
    
    Don't do capability element length checks in the capability element
    dissector, do it in the dissector for the particular capability element,
    and don't fail with a dissector bug report, fail with an expert info.
    
    Sort the ett[] array to match the list of ett_ definitions, to make it
    easier to check that they're all registered.

    Also there was an issue with different banners.  Now the banner length
    must match what we expect or the packet is rejected.  If the banner
    length changes the protocol is different and we won't be able to parse
    it anyways.

    Refactor "common" hostlist/endpoint table functionality.
    
    This is very similar in architecture to the changes made to the Conversation table functionality.  Since all conversations have endpoints/hostlists, the "registered" list is shared for both.

    If we don't find a NetScaler signature, don't report an error.
    
    It's *NOT* an error; it's just a file that isn't a NetScaler file.
    Otherwise, we report errors on files that should just be passed on to
    other open routines.
    
    Also, NetScaler files are *NOT* text files, and we should *NOT* use
    ".txt" as the suffix.

    -1 means "I got an error reading this file, so there's no point in

    An NLPID of 0xc0 refers to TRILL.
    
    This will, at least, make it show up as the meaning of a field

    follows" is another matter.
    
    At least partially addresses bug 10382, and fully addresses it if it's

commit d9e5021

Date:   Tue Aug 12 20:21:19 2014 -0400

    hip: fix infinite loop in dissect_hip_tlv
    
    We can't use tree_item == NULL to determine which branch of the previous if was
    hit, since proto_tree_add_item can return NULL when run without tree, which was
    leading to an infinite loop since we were never advancing the offset. Use the
    actual locator_type instead.
    
    Introduced by either g3635d7bed70 or gebff85fdbb although neither of them
    directly touch this code path. I'm guess that g3635d7bed70 removed an if (tree)
    guard in some calling function which would have prevented this, but I haven't
    checked. The bug would still have been there before, it just wouldn't have been
    hit because it's only present with a NULL tree. Somebody more familiar with the
    protocol should probably go over a capture or two and make sure this isn't a
    symptom of some other decoding gone awry in the recent changes.

    Clean up Internet checksum handling.
    
    Add macros to set entries of a vec_t, one for use when you have a
    pointer to private data, and one for use when you have data in a tvbuff.
    The latter wraps the use of tvb_get_ptr(), so that you're not directly
    calling it in a dissector.
    
    Move ip_checksum() to epan/in_cksum.c, and add an ip_checksum_tvb() that
    wraps the use of tvb_get_ptr().
    
    In the CARP dissector, give the length variable an unsigned type -
    there's no benefit to it being signed, and that requires some casts to
    be thrown around.
    
    In the DCCP dissector, check only against the coverage length to see if
    we have enough data, combine the "should we check the checksum?" check
    with the "*can* we check the checksum?" check in a single if, and throw
    a dissector assertion if the source network address type isn't IPv4 or
    IPv6.
    
    Get rid of inclues of <epan/in_cksum.h> in dissectors that don't use any
    of the Internet checksum routines.
    
    In the HIP dissector, make sure we have the data to calculate the
    checksum before doing so.

    The DRM DCP CRC-16 is the same as the X.25 CRC-16.

commit 22ad90c
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Fri Aug 8 08:57:31 2014 -0700

    Add routines for CRC-16 with a polynomial of 0x3D65.
    
    There are routines that take a buffer and a length and that take a
    tvbuff, offset, and length; use those routines in the DNP dissector
    (which no longer needs its own table and loop), and use the tvbuff
    routine instead of calling tvb_get_ptr().

    Fix support for decrypting 802.11 broadcast messages.
    
    A little bit of guess work is involved as the group key can use a
    different cipher to the pairwise key, and we are trying to do this
    purely based on the EAPOL messages with no prior knowledge of the
    associate request. We try to guess the cipher based on the lengths.

    The verify_tools target already passes $(PYTHON) to win-setup.sh --appverify;
    we just need to supply a default value for PYTHON, so that $(PYTHON) doesn't
    expand to an empty string. It's also convenient for the developer if Python
    can be automatically found on the PATH.

    Use a QTreeWidget instead of QTableWidget.
    
    Even though Qt's widget naming suggests otherwise, a QTreeWidget is
    usually a better choice for tables than QTableWidget. The former gives
    you a nice, clean Plain Old Table while the latter gives you something
    that looks and acts like a spreadsheet.
    
    In this particular instance using QTreeWidget also gives us the option
    of adding sub-items with detailed information. Do so for attached
    addresses.
    
    Allow sorting by traffic while we're here. Simplify the column hiding
    logic. Make sure the sparkline delegate isn't editable.

    trying to minimize if not eliminate its use in dissectors (it's a bit of
    what's called an "attractive nuisance", in that users who don't
    understand what it does - and doesn't! - do may use it in ways that are
    unsafe, e.g. thinking you can use it to get a null-terminated string
    from a packet).
    
    It also eliminates the possibility of passing one length to
    tvb_get_ptr() and another to crc32c_calculate().

    Added dissection of Device Capability Descriptors in CapResp Packets
    
    CapResp Packets may contain Device Capability Descriptors.
    This patch allows wireshark to show what descriptors are present,
    & checks that their length fields are valid.
    
    See section 6.3.3 of the MA USB spec for more information.

    Add support for android logcat text files
    
    Wireshark already supports reading and writing logcat
    logs saved in binary files. Binary format, although
    better, is used less often than saving those logs to
    text files.
    
    This patch extends wireshark's support for android logcat
    logs to reading and writing logcat logs in text files.
    
    Features:
    * support for tag, brief, process, thread, time, threadtime
      and long formats
    * saving in original format
    * it's generally awesome

    When doing the distcheck cmake check only verify that cmake runs, don't verify
    that it can build Wireshark.
    
    The purpose of the cmake check is to ensure we are distributing all the of
    necessary cmake files.  We don't want to get into the business of giving cmake
    all the options required to actually build Wireshark (e.g., which version of
    Qt is installed and where).
    
    This also means that distcheck doesn't compile Wireshark twice.

    When doing so, write out the selector for integral values in decimal, as
    older versions of Wireshark only handled decimal values, and some of
    those older versions are EOLed and won't be fixed.

    Remove a comment asking a question, as the answer is "no".
    
    I.e., no, the epan/decode_as.c stuff belongs in libwireshark, not libui,
    because dissectors need to be able to say "I support decode-as...".

    Initial Ceph Dissector.
    
    This is the first version of a Ceph dissector.  It is not complete but
    is far enough along to be helpful to many people working with Ceph.
    
    Currently the dissector can fully dissect the Ceph protocol and has
    support for full dissection of most common messages.  For the other
    messages for which full dissection is not available their metadata is
    parsed and shown along with the raw data of the different message
    sections.

    This makes the wslua test suite run in autofoo out-of-source-tree builds too.

    Get rid of debugging output, and get CMake to produce verbose makefiles.
    
    On the 32-bit OS X buildbot, automake is old enough that autotools
    builds are verbose, printing the command line for each compile step; if
    we cause CMake to produce verbose makefiles, they will also print the
    command line, so we can see what differences there are.
    
    This means the other debugging output we added isn't necessary; remove
    it.
    
    Sort the extra warning options in configure.ac based on whether they're
    for C and C++ or just C, just as is the case in CMake, to make it easier
    to keep the lists in sync; add comments to configure.ac to mirror the

    Remove get_next_di() and just use packet-scope for those
    
    Presumably that was added for tap purposes, but packet-scope is much simpler and
    less dangerous. Noticed while investigating the scan-build issues with

    Fix uninitialized session ticket
    
    If the tvb contained too few data,
    ssl_dissect_hnd_hello_ext_session_ticket would then allocate
    session_ticket, but not initialize the contents. Fix this by adding a
    check for the TVB length.
    
    The same is done for ssl_dissect_hnd_new_ses_ticket. That might, or
    might not, be necessary as proto_tree_add_item() is called with the
    range. When tree is NULL, ssl is usually NULL too. For clarity (and to
    avoid surprises in the future), add it anyway.

    wmem: get rid of the allocator timing test
    
    Some of the allocators are close enough that a little bit of system load at the
    time of the test was enough to throw them off, and it was causing unnecessary
    buildbot failures. Benchmarking on real-world cases at the time of
    implementation (as well as reliable "average" results on the buildbots) has left
    me confident that block_fast is, in fact, faster than block, which is faster
    than simple/strict.
    
    Additionally, the allocators are effectively "done" and unlikely to change, so
    the possibility of uncaught performance regressions is low.

    ssl: fix SSL keylog file live-capture use case
    
    Patch "ssl,dtls: simplify keyfile handling" did not account for the use
    case where packets are captured and decrypted on the fly using
    SSLKEYLOGFILE.
    
    This patch restores that functionality by reading additional lines from
    the keylog file when needed (to preserve the benefit of not having to
    read the full file) and by watching the open file for deletions.
    
    "Deletion" is detected by comparing st_dev and st_ino. Since these may
    be useless on Windows, the size is also checked.

    ssl,dtls: simplify keyfile handling
    
    Previously, the keylog file would be fully parsed when an encrypted
    pre-master secret is encountered or in the ChangeCipherSpec stage. There
    was also a lot of duplication in the key logfile parsing.
    
    This patch simplifies the key logfile parsing by using regular
    expressions. Rather than scanning the key logfile for a specific key,
    do this scan once at ssl init and save the results to a hashtable. The
    map for session ID/tickets to master keys already existed, another one
    for client random to master key and encrypted pre-master to pre-master
    was added. This could later also be wired to the "Export SSL Keys"
    menu item for improved reliability (when no session ID or tickets are
    available, the client random could be used).
    
    The ssl_{save,restore}_session{,_ticket} functions have been converted
    to a single function that looks up a key (sid / client random / encr.
    pre-master) to a (pre-)master secret.
    
    Other minor changes: return booleans for some functions that can only
    fail/pass. Remove some functions from the ssl-utils header that have
    become private a few commits ago. Remove some outstanding issues
    from the comments in packet-ssl as they are already done, add myself
    to the ssl-utils header.
    
    These changes pass the test suite and the sample Session Ticket-enabled
    capture from https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5963
    
    On-the-fly decryption are broken with this patch since keylog files are
    read once at the start of a capture. This will be solved in a future
    patch.

commit 304388a
Author: Gerald Combs <gerald@wireshark.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 30 09:33:43 2014 -0700

    Install our Qt DLL directories recursively.
    
    Qwindows.dll at least needs to be in the "platforms" subdirectory. Use a
    PowerShell script to convert the output of windeployqt to its equivalent
    NSIS instructions. Give the Qt DLL manifest a .nsh extension. Make sure
    we uninstall known Qt DLL directories. DLLs now load correctly according
    to Dependency Walker.
    
    Install and uninstall our .qm files while we're here.

    There is still some const-incorrect usage of them but those can be ironed
    out after this change has been made.

    Don't fail if unmounting the CMake disk image fails.
    
    I don't know why, but sometimes it fails - the most recent failure was
    due to it having already been unmounted!  Maybe the CMake installer
    unmounts it some times but not others.  Just drive on if it fails.

    Use ws_fstat64 instead of stat to support 64-bit file sizes on Windows.
    For the majority of the changes, this makes no difference as they do not
    apply to Windows ("ifndef _WIN32"; availability of st_blksize).
    
    There are no other users of "struct stat" besides the portability code
    in wsutil. Forbid the use of fstat and lseek in checkAPIs.

commit 2944d8b
Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Sun Jul 13 23:12:03 2014 +0200

    ssl: clarify meaning of StringInfo, cleanup PRFs, master_secret
    
    It was not clear whether the data_len member of StringInfo refers to
    the allocated memory (as was done for session_ticket) or the length
    of the actual data. This is clarified in a comment. To keep the
    invariant "data_len refers to the length of meaningful data", some
    code has been moved just in case some intermediate code fails:
    
     - Setting session_ticket.data_len vs tvb_memcpy to session_ticket.data.
     - PRF functions would expect the data length as input to a paramter
       named "out". This is highly confusing, so another parameter has been
       added to signify the requested length, "out_len". This also helps
       holding up the invariant.
     - For prf() calls, out.data_len does not need to be initialized but
       passed as parameter.
    
    Other PRF-related changes:
    
     - Change the PRF functions to return a boolean instead of an int.
     - tls_hash: return void as it cannot fail and remove related error
       handling from callers. Fix a memleak of label_seed if tls_hash was
       successful.
     - tls_hash: add comments to clarify its functionality, whitespace.
     - ssl3_generate_export_iv could not fail, so make it void. Also added
       an out_len param to pass the target length.
     - In prf(), replaced if-conditions for SSL version by a switch.
     - In ssl_generate_keyring_material, the scope of some variable has been
       tightened.
     - ssl_session_init: explicitly set data_len to 0. This is strictly not
       necessary as the callers have already zeroed out the memory, but that
       has not been documented.
    
    Other changes related to master_secret (ssl_save_session[_ticket]):
    
     - Initialize master_secret.data_len to 0 in ssl_session_init as the
       master_secret is unusable at that point.
     - Remove the hack that tests whether master_secret.data is non-empty.
     - Replace hardcoded master_secret length (48) from wmem_alloc0().
     - Introduce macro for master secret length, use this in
       SslDecryptSession, for parsing from keyfile and converting pre-master
       secret to master secret (prf).
     - Use (master_secret + 1) to refer to the part after the struct rather
       than adding the size manually to a gchar-casted master_secret.

    ssl,dtls: move Session Ticket to ssl-utils
    
    Changes:
    
     - dtls: also support saving session tickets.
     - Drop the length check and let proto_tree_add_item throw exceptions
       on length errors.
     - Use proto_tree_add_item instead of proto_tree_add_uint.
     - Drop "TLS" from header field descriptions, the RFC does not name it
       as such and DTLS can also use it (a draft is in progress that extends
       DTLS with Session Tickets,
       draft-hummen-dtls-extended-session-resumption-01).

    ssl,dtls: move ClientHello to ssl-utils
    
    Changes to ClientHello dissection:
    
     - Move ssl_find_private_key (and its pre-req, ssl_set_server) outside
       ssl_dissect_hnd_cli_hello. It has not really something to do with
       dissection, but state tracking and decoder param feeding.
     - dtls: add expert info for bad cipher suites len.
     - ssl: remove bad cipher suites len text label which is also
       available as expert info. Attach expert info to a the length proto
       item (which is converted to use add_item instead of add_uint).
     - Remove `if (tree || ssl)` since expert info seems not to apply
       otherwise (this also needs changes in common and handshake
       dissection).
     - ssl: remove tvb_ensure_bytes_exist so we can dissect more
       compression methods and cipher suites.
     - Since DTLS has an additional Cookie field which TLS does not have,
       pass these additional header fields through a struct whose type is
       defined in ssl-utils.

    ssl,dtls: move ServerHello to ssl-utils
    
    Changes to ServerHello:
    
     - Get rid of session parameter as the SslDecryptSession already
       provides a reference to SslSession. Done for the new
       ssl_dissect_hnd_srv_hello and ssl_dissect_hnd_hello_ext functions.
     - No need to generate the keyring here, decryption is only needed after
       ChangeCipherSpec and the keyring will be generated there provided
       that there are enough params (cipher, version, master-secret, etc.)
     - Get rid of labels and goto in favor of if/else.
     - DTLS: SSL_HAVE_SESSION_KEY is implicitly set when
       ssl_generate_keyring_material succeeds, no need to set it. Remove it.
     - Remove `if (tree || ssl)` since expert info seems not to apply
       otherwise (this also needs changes in common and handshake
       dissection). (Expert info from the TLS extensions, not the
       ServerHello itself.)
    
    Other changes:
    
     - ClientHello: renamed some fields shared with ServerHello.

    Get rid of NO_INTERFACES_FOUND - it's not an error.
    
    It just means "pcap didn't give me any interfaces, and didn't report an
    error".  Hopefully, in the future, there will be pcap APIs that
    distinguish between the (admittedly unlikely, these days) case of "there
    really *are* no interfaces on which *anybody* can capture" and "you
    don't have sufficient permission to capture", and we can report the
    latter as an error.  (Given that pcap supports more than just "regular
    interfaces", though, there are cases where you don't have permission to
    capture on those but you have permission to capture raw USB traffic, for
    example, so perhaps what's really needed is per-interface indications of
    permissions.)

Date:   Tue Jul 22 11:51:15 2014 -0700

    Don't return an error string for NO_INTERFACES_FOUND.
    
    Most callers of capture_interface_list() don't expect an error string
    for NO_INTERFACES_FOUND, because that's not really an error, it's just a
    statement of face (and perhaps an error of 0 should be returned), so
    they don't bother freeing the error string, causing a leak.
    
    Instead, have the one place that *did* expect it to return an error
    string just put "No interfaces found" itself.
    
    Also, have that place not check for an error string if interfaces *were*
    found, as no error code or string is returned in that case.

    Our users are not particpants in a comedy sketch.
    
    In way too many places in the GTK+ code we wait for the user to do
    something wrong, leap out from behind the bushes, yell "AHA!", and hit
    them in the face with a herring^W error dialog.
    
    We really need to not do that. We also shouldn't carry that behavior
    over to the Qt UI.
    
    If the user shouldn't press a button it should be disabled. Do so for
    the "Compile BPF" and "Start" buttons.

    [WIP] Add a conversation dialog.
    
    Items are sorted by value.
    
    Move common conversation code to ui/conversation_hash.[ch]. Add a
    conversation_type_e enum along with convenience functions for fetching
    titles, tap names, etc.
    
    We have a single main dialog instead of a main dialog + individual
    protocol dialogs. It de-clutters the statistics menu and results in
    simpler code. Conversation type tabs can be added and removed within the
    dialog itself. The tab list is sticky and saved with the current profile
    when the dialog closes. Data can be copied as CSV or YAML.
    
    Add a FilterAction class and a corresponding filterAction slot to
    MainWindow. Use it for the Conversations context menu.
    
    Add an addressResolutionChanged signal and related plumbing.
    
    Get rid of the iterator members in the conversation item struct. Update
    the GTK+ code accordingly.
    
    Excercise for the reader:
    - Update TShark to use the common hash code.

commit f724cae

Date:   Sat Jul 19 00:23:37 2014 -0700

    Only ABI-check strncasecmp.h if strncasecmp() is part of the API/ABI.
    
    Some routines Wireshark uses are present in some, but not all,
    platforms; for routines that would be used on all platforms, libwsutil
    provides its own implementations on platforms that lack them.
    
    On platforms that provide a routine, that routine will not be part of
    the API and ABI, and, if we do an API or ABI check using the header
    libwsutil provides to declare the function on platforms that lack it, we
    may have a collision between the declaration in our header and the
    declaration in a system header.
    
    There's no guarantee that we can make them match, as the declaration
    might differ from platform to platform and from platform version to
    platform version, so we simply leave the header file out of the check if
    we have the function on the platform on which we're checking the API or
    ABI.

    Allow expert info to show only items in the display filter.
    
    This was started by Chris Maynard before Qt was announced and I just polished it off for inclusion in GTK version of Wireshark.
    
    This also can be used as input into the Qt version of the Expert Info "dialog" since it hasn't been written yet.  Personally I like the "template" the Qt statistics dialog has with the display filter built it.  I think that would work well for the Expert Info dialog as well.

    Only one buffer.c, please.
    
    Otherwise, if you link with both libwiretap and libfiletap, it's
    anybody's guess which one you get.  That means you're wasting memory
    with two copies of its routines if they're identical, and means
    surprising behavior if they're not (which showed up when I was debugging
    a double-free crash - fixing libwiretap's buffer_free() didn't fix the
    problem, because Wireshark happened to be calling libfiletap' unfixed
    buffer_free()).
    
    There's nothing *tap-specific about Buffers, anyway, so it really
    belongs in wsutil.

Date:   Sat Jul 12 00:30:12 2014 +0200

    ssl: move decoder init from ClientKeyExchange to ChangeCipherSpec
    
    My previous change removed master-key retrieval in the Server Hello.
    This broke decryption when ClientKeyExchange is missing. That was done
    because decryption is only needed after ChangeCipherSpec.
    
    This patch moves the remaining initialization in ClientKeyExchange to
    ChangeCipherSpec. In theory this could fix decryption of DTLS traffic
    when an abbreviated handshake is used (and thus keyring material is
    never generated in ClientKeyExchange since it is not called).
    
    It also avoids saving a session ticket with an empty key which can
    happen when no RSA key is present, but the NewSessionTicket message
    is received. This could lead to garbage decryption.

    ssl: unify common Hello dissection to ssl-utils
    
    Based on DTLS code with changes merged from SSL. Changes:
    
     - Ignore large Session IDs, this was not harmful though since the
       backing storage was 256 bytes in size.
     - {ssl,dtls}.handshake.random: fixed description, it is not used like
       a SSLv2 random challenge.
     - dtls: also debug print client/server for random
     - SSL: the common dissector now returns an offset rather than dissected
       length.
     - dtls: display actual Session ID bytes in the UI rather than the text
       "Session ID (32 bytes)". The length field is already visible in the
       preceding field.
    
    Also changed is the handling of key material generation. The SSL
    dissector previously generated key material based on the Session ID,
    Session Ticket or a key logfile. (DTLS did not have this functionality.)
    As decryption is needed only after ChangeCipherSpec, I have removed it
    from the ServerHello handling. This will break decryption when a
    ClientKeyExchange message is missing, but it will be restored proper in
    a next patch.
    
    (By the way, there was an inverted if-condition bug in DTLS that could
    break decryption by not restoring the master key matching a SID. This
    is gone in the refactoring because the faulty code is removed.)

Date:   Thu Jul 3 11:23:19 2014 +0200

    logcat: improve (crash) robustness, improve names
    
    The logcat version detector would crash with ASAN enabled because it did
    not validate the payload length and hence a payload length of 0 would
    trigger out-of-bounds access. (This happened on non-logcat data.)
    
    This patch tries to get rid of all magic numbers by using a structure,
    improves the version detector to validate the payload length and
    prevents crashes due to missing nul-terminators in the input. Older
    Android kernels would create entries with __pad with random contents, so
    that cannot be used to determine version for v1. Instead, use heuristics
    on the priority, tag and maybe the msg field.
    
    Furthermore, Android is mostly (if not, always?) Little-Endian, so add
    conversions where necessary (just in case WS supports BE arches).
    
    "microseconds" has been renamed to "milliseconds" because that is what
    they are, actually. A duplicate logcat_log loop has been refactored
    such that one loop is sufficient, instead of separate buffers for each
    log part, a single one is now used. get_priority does not really need
    a pointer, just make it accept a character.
    
    The output has been validated against v1 and v2 logcat binary formats
    with __pad (hdr_size) equal to 0, and on attachment 9906.

    Use a QMutableListIterator instead of a foreach loop so that we can
    safely remove items from a list.
    
    While we're here, make sure that RecentFileStatus threads use a
    Qt::QueuedConnection when emitting signals across threads and try to

    Enhance HTTP/2 HPACK header decompression handling
    
    Previously we just call HPACK decompressor when dessecting packets.
    This is fine for the first linear scan.  But later same packet may be
    dissected more than once and their header block data will be fed into
    decompressor again.  This makes header compression context out-of-sync
    because HPACK decompressor only works when data is fed linearly.  This
    change fixes this issue by caching decompressed headers in the first
    linear scan.  On random packet dissecting, they are just looked up.
    This change adds support of changing header table size by inspecting
    SETTINGS frame and tracking its SETTINGS ACK.

    udvm: free the buffer *before* throwing the exception
    
    Freeing it after the exception doesn't do much, for obvious reasons. Also move
    the allocation a bit later, and add modelines.
    
    This fixes one major memory leak, although on inspection this code still isn't
    safe since there are exception-throwing functions called all over the place with
    glib memory active. Outside the scope of this fix though.

    conversion: do not free conversation memory on updates
    
    In commit 4afd70d ("Use g_hash_table_new_full to free some values"), the
    hashtable gained a destroy handler which frees memory. This
    inadvertently destroyed a conversation during key updates.
    
    Fix this by not calling _remove (and thereby calling the destroy
    handler), but use _steal instead. (Suggestion by Evan Huus).

    Qt: Cache packet list column strings.
    
    For each displayed packet list row, save a copy of or a pointer to
    column strings similar to ui/gtk/packet_list_store.c. This lets us call
    epan_dissect_run only once per row.

    Add printf-format annotations, fix garbage
    
    The WRETH dissector showed up some garbage in the column display. Upon
    further inspection, it turns out that the format string had a trailing
    percent sign which caused (unsigned)-1 to be returned by
    g_printf_string_upper_bound (in emem_strdup_vprintf). Then ep_alloc is
    called with (unsigned)-1 + 1 = 0 memory, no wonder that garbage shows
    up. ASAN could not even catch this error because EP is in charge of
    this.
    
    So, start adding G_GNUC_PRINTF annotations in each header that uses
    the "fmt" or "format" paramters (grepped + awk). This revealed some
    other errors. The NCP2222 dissector was missing a format string (not
    a security vuln though).
    
    Many dissectors used val_to_str with a constant (but empty) string,
    these have been replaced by val_to_str_const. ASN.1 dissectors
    were regenerated for this.
    
    Minor: the mate plugin used "%X" instead of "%p" for a pointer type.
    
    The ncp2222 dissector and wimax plugin gained modelines.

    Workaround for ASAN failure in _ws_mempbrk_sse42
    
    When ASAN is enabled, a false buffer overflow warning is raised. It is
    a false positive since everything starting at '\0' will get ignored by
    the PCMPISTRI instruction (see Intel(r) SSE4 Programming Reference,
    5.3.1.5 "Valid/Invalid Override of Comparisons", and 5.3.1.2
    "Aggregrate Operation", case "Equal any").
    
    Concerns about reading past the end of the page turns out to be false,
    there always seem to be a valid page after the current one (for static
    and heap memory at least). It is an non-issue since strlen also does
    not have issues with this.
    
    Rather than fully disabling SSE 4.2 and using the fallback
    implementation for ASAN-enabled builds, read the set of characters from
    'a' into the mask without a 128-bit read and then still use SSE 4.2
    for the actual query.

    Clean up handling of missing functions.

    HAVE_{function_name_in_all_caps}, otherwise don't #define it.
    
    If we provide our own version of a function in libwsutil, make sure we
    have a header that declares it, and *ONLY* include that header if
    HAVE_{function_name_in_all_caps} is *NOT* defined, so that we don't have
    the system declaration and our declaration colliding.
    
    Check for inet_aton, strncasecmp, and strptime with CMake, just as we do
    with autotools.
    
    Simplify the addition of {function_name_in_all_caps}_LO to libwsutil in
    autotools.

    is reduced from ~116 to ~3 seconds. I also tried it on NetBSD, where

commit 42b537e
Author: Evan Huus <eapache@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Jun 26 10:59:33 2014 -0400

    Reset state when cycling ring-buffer files in tshark.
    
    This has several implications:
     - we match user expectations that a ring-buffered tshark capture will run
       forever without running out of resources (except where we still have leaks)
     - we lose reassembly and request/response matching when the relevant packets
       are split across files, but this actually makes our output more consistent
       with dissecting those files after-the-fact
    
    I have not made it configurable in this change because I'm not really sure
    there's a use case for the old behaviour - if you're running a ring-buffer
    capture in the first place it's because you're willing to discard old data to
    limit resource usage. If you want the full dissection without breaks, just don't
    use a ring buffer at all and take the resource hit in both disk and memory.

    9p: fix version detection, fix dissect_9P retval
    
    Fix version detection (detect against full string instead of prefix),
    properly dissect Tcreate extension field (9p2000.u only), dissect
    Tunlinkat flags (9p2000.L).
    
    Refactor pattern to dissect string[s] types for DRY.
    
    Convert to use tcp_dissect_pdus. I have not seen a fragmented case, but
    maybe that may happen in the future.
    
    The main motivation for touching 9p was that it returns bogus values
    for some types. This has been fixed by properly increasing offset, and
    always return the captured length.

    catapult,irda: Fix ASAN crashes due to buffer underrun
    
    The catapult dissector tripped on this random file I had. A quick look
    at other dissectors which use a construct like "-1] *= '*\\[rn]" showed
    packet-irda too, so fix that as well.

    	dumpcap isn't built, it'll let you know that there's nothing to

    For Sun C with linker scoping specifiers, define WS_DLL_PUBLIC_DEF.
    
    This may let us, at least for those compilers, make the default "hidden"
    with -xldscope=hidden.

    Optimize epan_new/init_dissection
    
    As Anders correctly pointed out in I7d8f84b2e, constantly resetting state will
    turn init_dissection into a bit of a hot path. Especially as we will already
    bear the overhead of switching files, we don't want to fall any further behind
    than we have to.
    
    This change includes three unrelated optimizations that reduce the cost of
    init_dissection by about 40% as measured by callgrind:
     - only initialize ares/ADNS if that preference is enabled (this of course only
       applies if you specify -n to tshark or otherwise disable the preference)
     - use memcpy instead of a loop in sigcomp UDVM init
     - use memcpy instead of a loop in bootp dissector
    
    The only remaining obvious hot spot in this path is reassembly_table_init since
    it is called by so many dissectors. Suggestions (perhaps to get rid of the
    GPtrArray) welcome.
    
    Oh, and one other change to use g_strerror instead of strerror as insisted
    upon by the API pre-commit hook.

    TShark relies on dumpcap to capture packets, and TFShark doesn't even do

    Tighten the dump-glossary test.
    
     1. The only indication we get of an out-of-order value string is a message on
     STDERR, so check that and fail the test if STDERR wasn't empty.
    
     2. This exposes an out-of-order value string in packet-stun.c; fix it.
    
     3. This triggered the pre-commit hook on packet-stun.c, which noticed an API
     error (ENC_ASCII -> ENC_ASCII|ENC_NA); fix that too.

commit e22d3c9

Date:   Mon Jun 23 23:14:06 2014 +0200

    ssl: fix ClientKeyExchange, fix TLSv1.2 SKE for DH
    
    Since DTLS and TLS do not differ in handling ClientKeyExchange and
    ServerKeyExchange, its dissection got moved to ssl-utils. The code is
    based on the SSL dissector, with header field names adjusted to the
    DTLS ones (those got capitalized). Besides a version difference (for
    signatures), the header field and function names, the DTLS and SSL code
    are equal (this is verified).
    
    This patch refactors the dissectors for DHE_RSA and ECDHE to make use of
    a common function to dissect the signed_params field. All offset
    tracking is also removed in favor of exception handling by the
    proto_tree_add_item function. Occurrences of proto_tree_add_uint are
    also replaced by proto_tree_add_item for simplicity.
    
    After those changes, the SKE dissector for DH key exchanges is updated
    to handle the mandatory signature field in TLSv1.2, using the newly
    added function. (bug 9208)
    
    Another bug occurred after the length check removal, pre-TLS and
    OpenSSL's old DTLS implemenation do not include a vector length in
    the CKE. This is now also fixed. (bug 10222)
    
    Other minor changes: comments added/corrected, renamed
    keyex_dh -> keyex_dhe (includes DHE_RSA and DHE_DSS).

    That way, the code that constructs the runtime version string doesn't

    that don't call them.
    
    While we're at it, add "with" to the run-time version information for
    GnuTLS and libgcrypt, to match the compile-time version information, and
    add the version information from libwireshark to TShark.

Date:   Sun Jun 22 11:48:57 2014 -0700

    Replace C++-style comments with "#if 0"/"#endif".
    
    checkapi complains about C++-style comments, as some C compilers (IBM
    XLC, for one) reject them by default, and gcc -pedantic might do so as
    well.

    Point to the Cygwin mirrors page.
    
    If you choose to install from the Intertubes, you probably want to
    choose a nearby mirror site, rather than downloading from halfway across
    the world; the list of download sites in setup*.exe's UI gives no
    indication of where the mirror sites are, so you could end up picking
    one to which you have a slow Internet path.  Tell the user about the
    list of mirror sites on the Cygwin Web site, as that list *does* give
    geographical locations.

    Bluetooth: Complete sessions
    
    Some interfaces support multiple Bluetooth adapters with events like
    add/remove. We must support that to distinquish adapters streams
    in case that new adapter has the same id that old one.
    
    Next one is create session for "Connection Handle", so
    next layer will now when it is connected and disconnected.
    This is also used to distinguish streams.

    Add command-line argument to request the version to a number of the utilities.
    
    In some cases "-v" was already used so "-V" is the option.
    Note that the version information in these utilities is much shorter than what
    is presented by the big programs.

    Fix build without pcap.
    
    The files that use LONGOPT_CAPTURE_COMMON and OPTSTRING_CAPTURE_COMMON
    include capture_opts.h unconditionally, so there's no need to define
    them if we don't have pcap.  In addition, we want the capture options
    "available" even if we don't have pcap, so we can tell the user "you're
    using a version of *shark without pcap, but you gave a capture option".

Date:   Thu Jun 19 21:35:46 2014 -0400

    packet-vnc.c: Improve re-assembly.
    
    Essentially:
    
      When more data is needed to continue dissecting a PDU, use
      DESEGMENT_ONE_MORE_SEGMENT instead of repeatedly requesting
      additional bytes (for one or a few more fields).
    
      - Improves the efficiency of the dissection;
    
      - Prevents 'one-pass' tshark dissection from redissecting
        the PDU repeatedly many, many times with each time dissecting
        the PDU with one or a few more additional fields.
        This generated *lots* of (repeated) output since a reassembled
        VNC PDU can contain many fields (each of short length).
    
      - (A comment in packet-tcp.c states, in effect, that repeatedly
         requesting a specific amount of more bytes to dissect a PDU
         will "break reassembly" although I note that the reassembly did
         seem to work (in-efficiently)).
    
    Note: Although this patch improves the handling of reassembly, the
          dissector has significant issues. For example. see Bug #5366.
    
    I expect this fixes the Bug #10134 issue: "Cannot allocate memory";
    
    Before the fix, 'tshark -nVxr' for the input file generated trees with
    multiple hundreds of thousands of entries and generated reassembled
    PDUs consisting of many, many small fragments.

Date:   Wed Jun 18 10:16:24 2014 -0400

    Cleanup filter fields that checkdisplayfilter.pl was complaining about.
    
    Cleaned up filter names that were shared, but had different types (which can cause problems in a display filter compare)
    
    Also cleaned up many [FIELDDESCR] that effectively mimicked the field name.  Even more could probably be done (and/or rename field name to be more descriptive), but I was being conservative.

Date:   Thu Jun 19 14:22:54 2014 -0700

    Protocols sending the OS's AF_INET6 value are OS-specific or broken.
    
    Check for all the different AF_INET6 values that are on various OSes.
    If Totem is, and will forever be, used *ONLY* on one particular OS, feel
    free to remove the uses of other _AF_INET6 values (but do *not* change
    back to using the OS's AF_INET6; this should dissect the protocol
    correctly on *all* OSes).
    
    Add a common AF_INET definition to epan/aftypes.h while we're at it, and
    use that; as most OSes picked up 4.2BSD's AF_INET value, most if not all
    of them use 2, but IPv6 came out after 4.2BSD, and various OSes all
    picked their own values for AF_INET6.

    ep_address_to_str() doesn't crash if called outside packet scope, but
    it's still not correct to use outside packet scope.  Use
    address_to_str(NULL, ...) to allocate those strings, and then explicitly
    free them when we're done; exceptions don't get thrown between the
    allocate and free, so there's no risk of a leak.

    Separating the "try to guess whether there's a control word" type from
    the "yes, there's a control word" and "no, there's not a control word"

    We don't need -Qunused-arguments with Clang

    testing, causing us not to use the flag in question.  This means we

    check_c_compiler_flag checks for the message Clang prints for an unknown
    warning option ("unknown warning option '-WXXX'"), and fails if it's
    produced, so we don't need to force the compiler to fail by passing it
    -Werror=unknown-warning-option.
    
    (Yes, the CMake way of handling those annoying options is different from
    the way we do that in autotools - autotools adds flags to force errors,
    CMake checks for the warning messages - but that's OK.)

Date:   Wed Jun 18 01:44:44 2014 +0200

    Optimize tvbparse character set checking.
    
    This patch makes tvbparse_[not_]chars() to generate
    array of characters which is accepted,
    later this array is checked in cond_chars_common().
    
    This results in nice speedup of XML dissector (~33% for my file).

Date:   Tue Jun 17 22:46:56 2014 -0700

    If we don't check for something, don't print a result.
    
    This caues a bunch of bogus "no"s to be printed when testing for
    various compiler options when the compiler isn't GCC-like enough to
    accept GCC-style -W, -f, and -m flags.

    Don't do the check for clang/clang++.
    
    Adding -Qunused-arguments to CXXFLAGS causes the checks for -f and -m
    flags not to fail with clang++, causing the configure script to warn
    about -f flags supported by clang but not clang++ indicating that the
    compilers are a mismatched pair.
    
    The checks we do for flags should eliminate "unused" -f/-m flags,
    suppressing the warnings that way.

    Add -Werror when testing -m compiler flags.

    fail when passed an unknown -m flag.
    
    Also, if it's not a -W or -f or -m flag, don't forget to add it to
    CFLAGS and/or CXXFLAGS.

    When building an OS X package for GTK+, put the libraries in lib.
    
    This reverts to the way we did it prior to the switch to Qt; with GTK+,
    Contents/MacOS/Wireshark is just a launcher, and the Wireshark binary is
    in Contents/Resources/bin/wireshark-bin, and the appropriate rpath entry
    would be @executable_path/../lib - @executable_path/../Frameworks, which
    works for the Qt version, in which Contents/MacOS/Wireshark is the
    actual executable, doesn't work for the GTK+ version.
    
    This should fix bug 10185.

    glusterfs: correctly decode GFIDs that are passed in a dict
    
    When a dict structure is passed by GlusterFS, the values are not encoded
    normally. We now assume that the GFID in the dict is in network-order,
    but this will be incorrect for Big Endian systems. The majority of
    Gluster deployments are on Little Endian, and the GFID is displayed
    correctly for this case. I am sorry for the few users on Big Endian
    Gluster environments, they will see some GFIDs in Wireshark that don't
    exist on the Gluster volume.
    
    With this change, it is also made possible to filter on the GFID that is
    contained inside of the dict.

    Try to fix a used-but-not-set warning.
    
    I'm guessing that GCC is complaining because "device" isn't guaranteed
    to be set (if there are no interfaces, the body of the loop will never
    be executed), so do with the list of link-layer header types what's done
    for the buffer size and snapshot length.
    
    But should the column-setting code be executed if the interface isn't
    found?

commit 8ff7729
Author: Sean O. Stalley <sean.stalley@intel.com>
Date:   Fri Jun 6 15:07:00 2014 -0700

    Fix USB Class-Specific Control URB requests
    
    Fixes Bug 10165. (https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10165)
    
    The condition that caused the bug is a non-standard URB where the
    length of the tvb is less than the reported length. It will pass the
    tvb_reported_length_remaining() != 0, but fail the assertion in
    tvb_composite_append() (which checks the length value, not reported_length).
    
    This condition appears in a few other locations (where the if statement checks
    reported_length, but the code inside the if statement uses the length value).
    This patch also fixes them.
    
    Also removes depricated calls to tvb_length() & tvb_length_remaining()
    with tvb_captured_length() & tvb_captured_length_remaining(), respectively.

    Dissection of USB setup data in MA USB data packets
    
    This patch adds support for dissection of USB setup data contained
    inside of MA USB data packets. The MAUSB Dissector calls the same
    function used by the USB dissector to dissect the setup data.
    
    This patch also (and a bit unintentionally) adds transfer following.
    TransferReq & TransferAck packets now show a link & a time delta
    to their TransferReq (ie [Request in: XXX] & [Time from request: XXX].
    
    TransferReq packets have a [Response in: XXX] tag, but it erronously
    points to the TransferAck, not the TransferResponse.

    Wireshark-qt uses the Qt 4 libraries, but it is easy to switch

Date:   Thu Jun 5 10:53:32 2014 -0700

    Moved dissection of setup field to own function
    
    Dissection of all setup field types (standard & nonstandard) are
    handled in a seperate function. Before, nonstandard dissection was
    handled in dissect_usb_common.
    
    This is part of an effort to make dissect_usb_common() more modular
    so that code can be shared between the USB & the MAUSB dissector.

    - refs to true_false_strings should use TFS(&...) macro.

    This fix now allows SASL/GSS-API with integrity only to be properly dissected
    in that we now properly indicate the checksum and provide the wrapped token to
    the LDAP dissector to dissect.
    
    There is still a problem in that the wrong parts of the SASL packet can be
    indicated when users click on some parts.
    
    I am committing it for review and because it is much better than the current
    code.

    MAUSB dissector uses USB addresses
    
    The MAUSB dissector now prints the USB address for MAUSB data packets
    in the Source & Destination columns. Before, the IP address was
    printed.
    
    All MAUSB data packets are now part of USB Conversations. Like the
    USB dissector, all data to & from one endpoint are part of the same
    conversation.
    
    Issues that need to be resolved:
    - In the case where multiple MAUSB packets exist in one TCP packet,
      only one USB address can be printed.
    - The USB conversations do not appear in the conversations window.
      They should appear under the USB conversations tab.

    EIGRP Sequence TLV Dissector Patch
    
    In the EIGRP packet dissector, the dissector routine for the Sequence TLV
    dissected the TLV only up to the first address in the list. However, the
    Sequence TLV contains a variably sized list of addresses. This patch
    modifies the routine so that it processes the entire TLV, not just the
    first address in the contained list.
    
    Also, in the dissect_eigrp(), replaced calls to tvb_new_subset() with
    the reported length set to -1 with the call to tvb_new_subset_length().
    TLVs always carry information about their length. And this time,
    correct truly ALL calls in the switch{} section.
    
    Sample packet capture is available in BugZilla.

    used for protocols other than Ethernet.

    HTTP2: Showing decompressed headers
    
    Decode the HTTP/2 header block using nghttp2 HPACK decoder
    
    In this patch, We use nghttp2 HPACK decoder to decompress HTTP/2 header
    block.  To make HPACK decompressor work, we need to track down HTTP/2
    connection from the beginning.  If we see the HTTP/2 magic (connection
    preface), we initialize HPACK decompressor objects.  We actually use 2
    HPACK decompressor for both client and server.  HPACK decompressor
    objects are stored in hash tables using TCP stream index as a key.

    Example: if there is Connection Request than field with CID always
    is called SCID. If we Sent this packet, it is okay, but if we Receive
    it, then it is not SCID for us, but DCID. If we receive
    Connection Request (DCID) and than we want to make disconnection,
    so we send Disconnection Request with DCID that is SCID in
    Connection Request... etc.
    
    I try to clarify this, so rename stored SCID to Local CID
    and DCID  to Remote CID.

    Bluetooth: AVDTP: Upgrade session logic
    
    To correctly resolve connections single "ID" value
    like L2CAP PSM, is not enough, because next connection may use
    the same PSM value. Solution is save frame number of frame that
    make disconnection.
    
    Conclusion:
    Any session key values should be updated to pair:
    {ID_1, disconnect_in_frame}, {ID_2, disconnect_in_frame}...
    then we should check if  "disconnect_in_frame" is greater then
    current frame number, otherwise it is not valid session.

commit 21a1208
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Thu May 29 10:56:46 2014 -0700

    Introduce 802.11 dissectors with wired-in "FCS present" indications.
    
    For a number of protocols that encapsulate 802.11 frames inside packets,
    whether the frame includes an FCS or not is specified by the protocol,
    not by whether the link-layer frame carrying the packets *itself*
    includes an FCS.  As we've done with Ethernet, add "_withfcs" and
    "_withoutfcs" dissectors, which *don't* check the pseudo-header FCS
    length indication, and call those, rather than dissectors that check the
    pseudo-header length indication, from the dissectors for those protocols.

    In Anders profile output[1] is looks like that get_ether_name() is called

    This file is riddled with lots of magical flags causing the code to do

    Distinguish between "events" and "reports".
    
    Have two different classes of file-type-specific records - "events" and
    "reports".  An "event" indicates something that happened in the capture
    process, such as a status transition on the network; a "report" just
    gives information not corresponding to something happening in the
    capture process, such as capture statistics.
    
    Note that both of those should be dissected and displayed like packets,
    and leave open the possibility of file-type-specific records whose
    contents should be processed and saved but not displayed in the packet
    list.
    
    Shorten "file_type_specific" to "ft_specific".

Date:   Sat May 24 13:57:11 2014 -0700

    Add support for plugins to handle pcap-ng block types.
    
    We rename "file format" plugins to "libwiretap" plugins, as they can
    register as read handlers for a new file type, read/write handlers for a
    pcap-ng block type (or both).
    
    To register as a pcap-ng block type handler, in the
    register_wtap_module() routine of your plugin, call
    register_pcapng_block_type_handler() with the pcap-ng block type and
    pointers to your routines to read and write those blocks.  Those
    routines should read and write REC_TYPE_FILE_TYPE_SPECIFIC records, with
    the block type in the pseudo-header for the record in the struct
    wtap_pkthdr structure, with time stamps stored in that structure, and
    with a blob of data for the rest of the record.
    
    This is for bug 8590.

    Allow wtap_read() and wtap_seek_read() to return records other than packets.
    
    Add a "record type" field to "struct wtap_pkthdr"; currently, it can be
    REC_TYPE_PACKET, for a record containing a packet, or
    REC_TYPE_FILE_TYPE_SPECIFIC, for records containing file-type-specific
    data.
    
    Modify code that reads packets to be able to handle non-packet records,
    even if that just means ignoring them.
    
    Rename some routines to indicate that they handle more than just
    packets.
    
    We don't yet have any libwiretap code that supplies records other than
    REC_TYPE_PACKET or that supporting writing records other than
    REC_TYPE_PACKET, or any code to support plugins for handling
    REC_TYPE_FILE_TYPE_SPECIFIC records; this is just the first step for bug
    8590.
