commit e209b4c527
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Thu Sep 28 12:23:12 2017 -0700

    Have dissect_7bit_string() return a const gchar *.
    
    Nobody needs to modify the string, and nobody needs to free it - which
    is good, because it could be a string constant which can neither be
    modified nor freed.

Date:   Sun Sep 24 13:01:49 2017 -0700

    Replace DISSECTOR_ASSERT(hfinfo->type == FT_STRING) with DISSECTOR_ASSERT_FIELD_TYPE.
    
    That produces better error messages, giving the name of the offending
    field.

    Move DISSECTOR_ASSERT_FIELD_TYPE_IS_TIME after __DISSECTOR_ASSERT_FIELD_TYPE_IS_TIME().
    
    That's consistent with the other DISSECTOR_ASSERT_FIELD_TYPE... macros.
