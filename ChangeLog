    If we're reading from a string, don't fclose yyin.
    
    yyin is initialized to stdin.  When we're reading from files, we set it
    so that it points to the FILE from which we're reading, but when we're
    reading from a string, we don't set it, leaving it to point to stdin.
    
    This means that, just as the "read from the input" routine has to be set
    differently when reading from a file or a string, the "close the current
    input" routine has to be set differently as well.

    TRANSUM: Fix DNS-related bug and improve performance
    
    These changes significantly improve the speed and accuracy of TRANSUM.
    
    I have removed the concept of rrpd status as it wasn't being used in any
    significant way and created unnecessary code.
    
    The find_latest_rrpd(...) function was becoming very complex which made it
    difficult to optimise performance for certain protocols.  To overcome
    this, I have introduced an equivalent function for each protocol e.g.
    find_latest_rrpd_smb2(...). each of these new functions has a loop that
    steps through the rrpd_list.  I could have placed this loop one level up
    in the nested call and so had one loop in the code that calls the new
    function.  However, I have found that this area is the prime cause of
    delays in TRANSUM execution and so I want to avoid calling these new
    functions with each step through the rrpd_list.
    
    Finally, I have added code to improve the handling of retransmissions.

    In some dialogs, have *no* auto-default buttons on macOS.
    
    In macOS dialogs, there's a default button, which is the button that
    Enter/Return activates, and that Enter/Return *always* activates,
    *regardless* of what button has the input focus.  To activate the button
    that has the input focus, you use the space bar.
    
    To implement that, we need to disable auto-default on all buttons,
    including the Cancel button.
    
    Put in a comment explaining all this.
    
    We may want to do this in all alert boxes, and possibly all dialogs with
    buttons.

    At least as I read C90 "6.5.7 Initialization" and C99 "6.7.8

    nordic_ble: Fix delta time start-to-start calculation
    
    The on-air time for a packet was calculated wrong because it was
    using the wrong number of on-air bytes.  This has been corrected.
    
    Calculating delta time start-to-start for BLE 4.2 requires support
    for on-air packet size up to 255 bytes (LE Data Length Extensions).
    For this the payload length size in the header has changed to two
    bytes.
    
    Calculating delta time start-to-start for BLE 5.0 needs physical
    layer data rate (LE 1M PHY or LE 2M PHY). For this the flags was
    extended with PHY values.
    
    Removed superfluous min and max length checks.

    When looking up response codes, just keep the key on the stack.
    
    We don't need to dynamically allocate a guint variable to hold the
    response code value - and then not bother to free it! - if we're just
    doing a lookup; we can use an automatic variable and pass a pointer to
    it.

    Fix another leak, which happens with -E occurrence=l.
    
    For each occurrence, if there was already an occurrence in the array, we
    were just removing it. not freeing what it pointed to.
    
    While we're at it, expand comments. and always check the array size with
    "!= 0", not "> 0" - the value is unsigned, so they're equivalent, but
    this makes the code more self-consistent.

    mp4: limit the recursion depth for boxes
    
    Although the dissection of each box header consumes a couple of bytes,
    it turned out that it's still possible to crash wireshark with a sample
    file that contains a large number of nested boxes. The stack will fill
    up before we reach the end of the data bytes.
    
    Keep track of the recursion depth as we walk through the hierarchy of
    boxes. Abort if we reach the (locally defined) upper limit.

Date:   Wed Feb 28 17:52:34 2018 -0800

    Don't handle various "command to send" values in the default case.
    
    The default case ignores the high-order bit, which is set in all the
    values for "command to send", so they will never be matched.  The values
    moved out of the default case, if their upper bit is clear, either don't
    correspond to any command in T.30 or correspond to an initial
    identification command, which never has the upper bit set, so there's no
    risk of misidentification by processing all of the "command to send"
    values outside the default case.
    
    Thanks and a tip of the Hatlo hat to Visual Studio Code Analysis for
    catching this one.

    Fix a heap buffer overflow (write) when the message header length is
    smaller than the actual message payload length. Add expert info to
    detect this since it can also occur when the header is wrongly matched
    with a data fragment (this dissector issue is not fixed here).
