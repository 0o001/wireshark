Date:   Mon Feb 23 17:56:14 2015 -0800

    Qt: Add extra related packet indicator types.
    
    Add the ability to set frame number types: none, request, or response.
    Use the types to draw different related packet indicators in the packet
    list.
    
    Track the conversation in PacketListRecord. Use it to draw dashed lines
    for unrelated frames.
    
    Set frame number types for DNS and ICMP.
    
    Instead of drawing a transparent QImage, alpha blend our foreground
    color and draw directly in our painter. Blend more toward the foreground
    color.
    
    Add FRAMENUM_TYPE to checkAPIs.

    AMQP: Introduce support for AMQP over TLS/SSL (AMQPS).
    
    Modified dissect_amqp to the new-style dissector.
    Added amqp.ssl.port to protocol preferences.
    Registered the AMQP dissector with SSL.
    
    Fixed an error in dissect_amqp that appeared when the first segment was smaller
    than the minimum header size required to determine the protocol version (8b).
    
    ...plus enhanced the AMQP 0-9-1 to display also the protocol id,
    so the packets list shows "0-9-1" instead "9-1".

commit 499d959
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Mar 3 02:47:53 2015 -0800

    Eliminate e_uuid_t in favor of e_guid_t.
    
    That eliminates a redundant and confusing data type, and avoids issues
    with one piece of code using e_uuid_t but wanting to use routines
    expecting an e_guid_t.

    While only WiMax needs this change, do a similar thing for consistency
    with autofoo and between dissectors (actually, the contents of

    RTP player: don't crash when drawing channel graphs for very long calls.
    
    X11 can't handle pixmaps more than 32k pixels wide so don't try to feed it
    one.  This avoids crashes with the complaint "BadAlloc (insufficient
    resources for operation)".  Instead we simply truncate the graph (and tell the
    user).  Do this in a way that shows the user the empty portion of the graph.
    
    Hopefully the Qt port can fix this properly.
    
    Note: the bug report says that MacOS is not affected but it should be.  So
    apply this fix for all on-Windows systems.

commit 7130875
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sat Feb 28 12:35:16 2015 -0800

    Convert fixed-point binary to floating-point in a portable fashion.
    
    No need to try to construct an IEEE floating-point number by hand, piece
    by piece; just sign-extend the value to 32 bits, convert that integral
    value to a floating-point value, and divide the result by 32768 to
    properly scale the value.
    
    (Yes, in practice, the chances are overwhelming that we'll be running on
    a machine with IEEE floating point - people probably won't be running us
    on a VAX, and the UN*Xes on which we're likely to run on a System/3x0 or
    z/Architecture machine require, and use, the new IEEE floating-point
    capabilities - but no need to be gratuitiously non-portable.)

    Don't use ctime().
    
    The API checks warn about it being deprecated - that doesn't seem to
    cause a problem with the buildbot, but does result in failures from the
    Petri dish.  Format the first and last packet time in an ISO 8601-style
    format.
    
    Call them "First packet time" and "Last packet time", rather than "Start
    time" and "End time", as they're not necessarily the times when the
    capture started or ended.
    
    (Both make the output a bit more like the Statistics -> Summary window.)

    We never use it; the autoconf script does, but that's as a result of
    some macros that checks for various standard and non-standard-but-common

    Qt: Automatically scroll the packet list.
    
    Add an "Auto Scroll in Live Capture" action to the Go menu. It's in the

    item.
    
    Use a timeout interval for automatic scrolling. I haven't run any tests
    to see if this makes a difference but it would seem that the less
    drawing we do during a high speed capture the better, particularly for
    remote displays.
    
    Update the x-stay-last icons.
    
    Note that we might want to make prefs.capture_auto_scroll a "recent"
    setting.
    
    Mark auto_scroll_live and packet_list_check_end GTK+ only.

    Use tcp_dissect_pdus() in the SSTP dissector.
    
    I happened across the discussion in Ia44e0791b6ee78ad594de342c4f2401bad9beb4e
    which indicates that protocols running over SSL can use tcp_dissect_pdus() too.
    So do it in the SSTP dissector.

    Qt: Apply recent settings.
    
    Add PacketList::applyRecentColumnWidths which set the packet list
    column widths from our recent settings. Make sure it gets called at
    startup and when we change profiles.
    
    Save the packet list header state so that we can restore it when we
    reset the model (i.e. freezing and thawing) and load a new capture file.
    Save the state when the user resizes a column. As a side effect this
    works around a weird bug that adjusts the width of column 1 at an
    inopportune time.
    
    Add a profileChanging signal so that we can save the main window geometry
    in each profile.
    
    Get rid of MainWindow::configurationProfileChanged. It was unused.
    
    Apply saved pane widths and heights. Note that we might want to add a
    separate pair of recent settings for the Qt panes.
    
    Use the last opened directory in the capture file dialog.
    
    Git rid of some unneeded Q_UNUSEDs while we're here.

    websocket: avoid recursion, use tcp_dissect_pdus
    
    Use tcp_dissect_pdus to handle reassembly and avoid a recursion in
    dissect_websocket. The HTTP dissector is modified to preserve
    desegmentation functionality (tested with the capture from bug 8448).
    
    As tcp_dissect_pdus is used now, the workaround for bug 8448 can be
    removed and the actual frame dissection logic becomes simpler (the
    length is checked in get_websocket_frame_length).

    Qt: Fix a crash when changing the layout.
    
    Freeze and thaw the packet list when changing the layout. This has the
    side effect of clearing the proto tree and byte view, which avoids
    reading a bad tvb pointer. Note that we might want to add a cleanup
    callback to free_data_sources.

    Use file extensions even more as a heuristic.
    
    If a file type has a list of "typical" extensions, and a file has an
    extension that is *not* one of those extensions, the file is unlikely to
    be of that type.
    
    For files that have extensions, after we try the heuristics that have a
    list of "typical" extensions that includes the file's extension, try the
    heuristics that have no such list, and after that try the heuristics
    that have such a list but where the list *doesn't* include the file's
    extension.
    
    This fixes, for example, some cases where non-PacketLogger files were
    getting identified as PacketLogger files.

    In cases that "should not happen", and where we might *not* be executing
    in the context of a dissector (filling in the field label can be done
    lazily, being deferred to "print" time, and that doesn't happen in the
    context of a dissector), use g_assert_not_reached() rather than
    DISSECTOR_ASSERT_NOT_REACHED() - the latter throws an assertion that's
    not caught if we're not doing dissection, so we crash anyway.

    checkAPIs: match packet-*.[ch], independent of locale
    
    In perl, the \w character group seems to match '-' depending on the
    locale. On Linux (with the C or en_US.UTF-8 locale), packet-ssl-utils.c
    does not match.
    
    This patch makes the regex match anything except for the path separator.

    - Move the version and repository branch to the flavor label?
    
    - Add update links as appropriate to the bottom.

    Add a dissector for Microsoft's SSTP protocol.
    
    ... with some changes from Jeff Morriss:
    - Change how SSTP is "registered": rather than trying something complicated,
      just put the intelligence for recognizing SSTP into the HTTP dissector.
      (This does mean the SSTP dissector needs to do its own desegmentation now
      but it makes things much cleaner.)
    - Use proto_tree_add_subtree_format() instead of proto_tree_add_text() +
      proto_item_add_subtree().
    - The messagetype is 16 bits, use tvb_get_guint16() instead of tvb_get_guint8()

    ssl: check for minimal SSLv3/TLS record size
    
    When a TLS record is fragmented over multiple TCP segments, with its
    first byte in one segment, and the remainder over the others,
    ssl_looks_like_sslv3() throws an exception because it tries to access
    the third byte.
    
    This breaks the encryption state, resulting in very weird (scrambled)
    decrypted data. To fix this, check the record size before using it. Also
    add TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 as known version.

    Check whether emmintrin.h can be used *without* -msse4.2.
    
    If not, we can't use SSE 4.2, as we need to be able to include it in
    files that use tvb_pbrk_compile()/tvb_pbrk_exec() even if they're not
    compiled with -msse4.2 (most files aren't, as we need to isolate SSE 4.2
    instructions to a small bit of code that uses them only if running on
    hardware that supports them).

    The clang on my machine doesn't; just do "format" instead.  (The best

    get thousands separators on *all* platforms, regardless of whether its

    sufficient care to avoid warnings - I'm looking at *you*, Flex - makes
    it impossible to fix without introducing other problems, using the
    DIAG_OFF()/DIAG_ON() macros if possible).  Eliminate the empty lists, to
    make it harder to fill them up again.

    conversation is about to initiate a secure sockets connection (kind of
    like STARTTLS) and then pass all packets through the SSL dissector
    if that is the case. Also clean up some duplication with constants.

Date:   Mon Feb 16 15:14:57 2015 -0500

    Give users a more helpful error message if they enter an SSL protocol we don't
    know.
    
    First, if we know the protocol (by filter name) tell them that the dissector
    just isn't set up to run over SSL but it could be--if they contact the Wireshark
    developers.
    
    Second, don't tell them that the dissectors which have called
    ssl_dissector_add() are the only ones that are valid; those are just commonly
    used ones.

    Qt: fix "Assigned value is garbage or undefined"
    
    Clang Static Analyzer reported that function link_changed uses a garbage
    value for "device.links" which is indeed the case when
    global_capture_opts.all_ifaces->len == 0.
    
    There seem to be some issues here:
     - When global_capture_opts.all_ifaces->len == 0, then device is
       uninitialized.
     - When no interface name matches, the last entry will always be
       updated.
     - There is duplicate code querying for the interface by name.
    
    This patch addresses the above issues by extracting the interface name
    check into a new utility function which returns NULL when a device is
    not found. Then the callers (such as link_changed) will check this
    value.
    
    While at it, stop storing a copy of (interface_t), use a pointer
    instead. This allows for removal of g_array_remove_index followed by
    g_array_insert_val.
    
    Verified with clang 3.5.1.

    Fix handling of invalid UAT items
    
    If the UAT file failed a field check, then the user_data pointer may be
    empty. As a result uat_save() triggers an invalid write.
    
    (Discovered while working with a dfilter_macros file having duplicate
    names for bug 10957, caught by ASAN.)
    
    The second issue fixed in this patch is that the validity of an item is
    only calculated when a new record is added. So even if the user edits
    the UAT and makes the entry valid, it would not be saved. This is solved
    by adding a new uat_update_record() function which got wires up into GTK
    and Qt.
    
    Some open-coded g_array_index and UAT[_USER]_INDEX_PTR are also
    converted.
    
    Even after this patch, Qt has some issues with UAT handling. In
    particular, it saves new, but empty/invalid, items. It also it does not
    check individual fields when saving all fields (unlike Gtk). This patch
    focused on getting Gtk fixed first so ignores those existing issues.

    Handle DLT_LOOP differently from DLT_NULL.
    
    That's a little cleaner, and lets us preserve the LINKTYPE_ value for
    DLT_LOOP captures.  ("Preserve" here doesn't mean "write files with a
    link-layer header type of 12", as that's ambiguous; we write it with a
    link-layer header type of LINKTYPE_LOOP, i.e. 108.  If programs on
    OpenBSD don't recognize that as DLT_LOOP, that's a bug in OpenBSD's
    libpcap or in the program.)

    Don't base interpretation of LINKTYPE_ values on DLT_ value definitions.
    
    Instead, explicitly check for particular build platforms.  This means
    that the interpretation of the link-layer type values with different
    meanings on different platforms won't be dependent on the particular
    version of libpcap with which Wireshark happens to be built, and also
    means that we don't have to fix pcap-common.c to include pcap.h or
    net/bpf.h.

    The first packet is an IPv6 packet with Local Mobility Anchor Address mobility option with Option-Code=1. Wireshark parses its address as IPv4 address.
    
    The second packet is an IPv6 packet with Local Mobility Anchor Address mobility option with Option-Code=2. Wireshark parses its address as IPv6 address.
    
    According to RFC 5949 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5949#section-6.2.2), Option-Code=1 means IPv6 and Option-Code=2 means IPv4, exactly the opposite to what Wireshark does.

    There is no guarantee that a g_malloc'ed memory block will be aligned on a 128 bits boundary
    Instead use a static variable definition (at the cost of exposing the HAVE_SSE4_2 compilation flag in ws_mempbrk.h)

Date:   Wed Feb 11 14:19:57 2015 -0800

    Fix SSE 4.2 checks.
    
    CMake has "normal" and "cache" variables, and unexpected things happen
    if you have a normal and a cache variable with the same name.
    Apparently, check_c_compiler_flag() currently sets its result variable
    as a cache variable, and set(), by default, sets it as a normal
    variable.
    
    This means that there are two different HAVE_SSE4_2 variables, and the
    top-level CMakeLists.txt looks at the cache variable when it creates
    config.h; this means that if the nmmintrin.h test fails, config.h still
    says we have SSE 4.2.
    
    Instead, use separate variables for the "compiler can be made to
    generate SSE 4.2 code" test and the "nmmintr.h works" test; that way we
    don't have to worry about normal vs.  cache variables (and don't have to
    worry about CMake changing what type of variable particular
    functions/macros set).

    Combine SSE and pre-compiled patterns for faster pbrk
    
    This combines the SSE4.2 instructions usage, with pre-compiled
    pattern searching usage, for a faster pbrk search method.
    
    Testing against large files of HTTP and SIP, there is about
    a 5% performance improvement by using pre-"compiled" patterns
    for guint8_pbrk() instead of passing it the search string and
    having it build the match array every time.
    Similar to regular expressions, "compiling" the pattern match array
    in advance only once and using the "compiled" patterns for
    the searches is faster than compiling it every time.

    Add a "Sum" column to the Service Response Time (SRT) window.
    
    The Service Response Time (SRT) window currently provides the
    columns: Index, Procedure, Calls, Min SRT, Max SRT, and Avg SRT.
    A Sum column has been found useful in some customer situations
    to understand the total time spent doing a set of procedures.
    For example, in one case we were trying to isolate whether most
    time was being spent on a client thread or in the act of making
    outbound calls. We knew the start and end time of the client call,
    so with the "Sum" of time spent in that period, we could isolate
    a particular set of procedures driving the slow down.
    
    Additional changes made in this patch:
    * Add " (s)" to Min, Max, Avg, and Sum columns to make it clear
      that times are in seconds.
    * Refactor out width and height constants used in calls to
      gtk_window_set_default_size in most of the SRT users into
      #define SRT_PREFERRED_WIDTH and SRT_PREFERRED_HEIGHT. Also
      increase the common width of 550 to 650 to account for the
      additional column.

    ldap: simplify Start TLS handling
    
    RFC 2830 describes the Start TLS operation as follows:
    
     1. ExtendedRequest is sent by client with the requestName OID set to
        "1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.20037".
     2. Server responds with an ExtendedResponse having a resultCode and
        optionally a responseName (OID).
    
    The text mentions that the field *must* be set but the definition allows
    it to be optional. The previous code then made assumption that once (1)
    was seen, then any ExtendedResponse signals an acknowledgement.
    
    That is not entirely correct, a server could reject the request. This
    patch corrects that by checking the ExtendedResponse_resultCode for
    success, and then uses the new ssl_starttls_ack() helper to kick off
    SSL. This simplifies the code a bit.
    
    Tested against ldap-ssl.pcapng (which has no responseName) from
    http://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures#SSL_with_decryption_keys
    The result is the same as before, except that "Protocols in frame"
    changed from "...:ldap:ssl:ldap" to "...:ssl:ldap".

    Fix STARTTLS handling in various dissectors
    
    This patch lets a dissector hand over control to the SSL dissector which
    simplifies dissector code ("TCP | App | SSL | App" becomes
    "TCP | SSL | App").
    
    After this patch, all of the affected dissectors will now be dissected
    as SSL with its Application Data being treated as the protocol before
    STARTTLS. This was previously not the case because the port was not
    registered for dissection via ssl_dissector_add.
    
    The desegmentation issue within the MySQL dissector is now also gone.
    Convert some tvb_length[_remaining] users in pop and smtp as well.
    
    Tested against mysql-ssl.pcapng and mysql-ssl-larger.pcapng(*1),
    Tested against pop-ssl.pcapng (note: only first stream is decrypted,
    either the key after negotiation is wrong or there is a bug),
    Tested against smtp-ssl.pcapng and smtp2525-ssl.pcapng (with Decode As)
    and smtp-ssl.pcapng with filter "tcp.len>0",
    Tested against xmpp-ssl.pcapng,
    http://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures#SSL_with_decryption_keys
    
     *1) mysql-ssl-larger has MySQL dissector errors for the fragmented
         SSL packet, but reassembly seems to work. Needs further
         investigation.

commit 93ed726
Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Thu Feb 5 19:54:52 2015 +0100

    ssl,dtls,ssl-utils: Prepare for STARTTLS handling
    
    All STARTTLS-like dissectors (protocols which can switch to SSL/TLS
    after a protocol command) currently fail to get called after decryption.
    The reason for this is that the port is not registered for SSL
    dissection via ssl_dissector_add. Besides this, the MySQL dissector
    breaks in the event of multiple segments because it does not properly
    set desegmentation.
    
    The call path TCP | App | SSL | App is a bad, error-prone pattern which
    requires duplication of required functionality in dissectors. This patch
    enables to bypass the App (TCP | SSL | App) by registering a SSL as
    conversation dissector after a STARTTLS switch.
    
    Logical overview of changes:
    
     - Move srv_addr, srv_ptype and srv_port to SslSession and adjust the
       users. This allows passing SslSession around which will never be null
       unlike SslDecryptSession. This is needed for looking up the packet
       direction (server or client) before calling a subdissector.
     - Add app_handle to store the dissector and last_nontls_frame the
       frame that initiated STARTTLS.
     - The same app_handle is now used to store the dissector handle from
       a ssl association.
     - Moved conversation data (SslDecryptSession) to ssl-utils to avoid
       code duplication. Merge ssl_session_init into it. The new
       ssl_session_get() is needed for STARTTLS frame/handle storage.
     - Introduce new "ssl_starttls_ack" function to signal the last non-TLS
       packet.
     - Ensure that match_uint is set before calling the conversation
       dissector. This ensures that dissectors using match_uint to check
       the direction of a packet (client vs. server) see the TCP port
       instead of the IP proto. At least the MySQL and SMTP dissectors
       require such special treatment.
     - Move epan/conversation.h outside HAVE_LIBGNUTLS, remove from dtls
       (as it is already included by ssl-utils).
     - Various comment/debug string updates. Remove outdated comment before
       SSL association lookup.
    
    Besides setting match_uint and caching the app_handle, existing
    dissectors should not be affected by this patch. Follow-up patches
    will update existing dissectors to use the new ssl_starttls_ack
    interface.

    Add address type registration.
    
    Now address types are setup just like field types and must be registered with a structure that provides its string representation (and more things in the future).  Address types that are limited to a single dissector are registered by the dissector.  More "common" ones are globally registered.  There are still a few that really belong in a dissector, but have other dependencies currently not accounted for in the address type support.
    
    Many of the "address to string" conversions that involved g_sprintf have be changed to use more "performance friendly" methods (some at the cost of needing to_str-int.h)
    
    Leaving all comments regarding this "solution" in address_to_str.c in until all have been implemented

    to confusion and *does* lead to compile errors on platforms where, for

    Re-select the current packet if the layout changes so that the proto

    WSDG: Fixup admonition block formatting.

    MySQL: fix assert  when the Connect Attrs capability is set, but no attributes
    
    From
    <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/connection-phase-packets.html#packet-Protocol::HandshakeResponse>
    (emphasis mine):
    
    Starting with MySQL 5.6.6 the client **may** send attributes if CLIENT_CONNECT_ATTRS is set:
    
    Does this mean that the capability *may* be set, but the list of attributes can be empty?

    Should probably fix an unintialized memory access caught by valgrind, although I
    can't reproduce it because out-of-tree plugins are still broken.

    OK, try cmake -E copy.
    
    It didn't fail with cp, so maybe that's just random luck, or maybe the
    built-in copy functions have an issue, or maybe just copy_if_different
    has an issue (64-bit inode number issues?).  Try just copy, and see what
    happens.

    On OS X, temporarily use cp to install some files.
    
    The 32-bit OS X build is failing rather often due to cmake -E
    copy_if_different failing to copy wireshark.html, and to call cmake's
    copy functions completely crappy at reporting errors is to insult
    software that's merely completely crappy at reporting errors.  Try using
    cp in the hopes that it'll actually tell us *WHY* the copy is failing
    and see if we can fix it.
