    Remove a cast that now causes rather than squelching warnings.
    
    We're now comparing an unsigned with an expression made mostly of
    unsigned, so there's no need to cast the expression to long to squelch
    signed vs. unsigned warnings.

    Make sure nspr_getv20recordsize() returns an unsigned value.
    
    The record size fields are guint8, but NSPR_V20RECORDSIZE_2BYTES was
    0x80, which has type int, promoting the result to int.  Make it 0x80U,
    which means everything is unsigned.
    
    This squelches a compiler warning.

    IEEE 802.11: Handle Atheros padding
    
    For some unknown reason between 802.11 protocol fields end and LLC
    protocol field start two octets of padding may appear. These octets
    (value 0x00) were observed on the OLPC laptop, heuristically detected
    and marked as OLPC mysterious stuff.
    
    It seems that Atheros chipset drivers also show this behaviour,
    although the padding is not 0x0000, but seem to be a duplicate of the
    sequence control field. This is now also heuristically detected and
    marked more generically as payload padding.

    Don't go past the end of a page in a NetScaler file.
    
    Records in a properly formatted NetScaler file shouldn't go past the end
    of a page, but nothing guarantees that a NetScaler file will be properly
    formatted.
    
    NetScaler 3.x files allow record bodies to go past the end of a page,
    but 1.x and 2.x files don't, so treat record headers that go past the
    end of a page, and record bodies in 1.x and 2.x files that go past the
    end of a page, as errors.
    
    Clean up some stuff while we're at it.

    Rawshark: Try to avoid a VC runtime crash.
    
    The MSDN documentation for _read says
    
    "If fd is invalid, the file is not open for reading, or the file is
    locked, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in
    Parameter Validation."
    
    This means that on Windows, if our parent has closed stdin when we call
    _read we'll crash. Add a check to bail out early if that's happened.
    
    Fix a sign cast while we're here.

    Qt: Warn the user about DBAR 1.8 on Windows.
    
    At startup, dig through the registry looking for shell extensions. If
    any of them match known Dell Backup and Recovery DLL names and the DLL
    version matches 1.8.*.*, show the user a warning dialog.
    
    This is a bit extreme but I'm not sure what else to do. Dell is a popular
    computer manufacturer and bug reports keep trickling in.

    mswsp: Numerous bugfixes
    
    1. Fix display of CTableColumn.StatusUsed & CTableColumn.LengthUsed
    Both StatusUsed and LenghtUsed members were displayed as 2 byte length
    values instead of single byte values.
    
    2. Fix minor spelling mistake
    
    3. display correct address(s) for array of address values
    
    4. Use correct minimum CTableColumn size
    
    This is followup patch for patch already provided for bug 13299.
    The previous minimum value neglated to take into account the
    CFullPropSpec structure (which is on the wire) but is represtented
    as a string in the internal CTableColumn structure. Note: this doesn't
    make any difference to the effectiveness of the previous patch but should
    avoid confusion if someone later actually investigates the correct minimum
    size.
    
    5. Fix CPMCREATEQUERY message parsing
    
    Following a query and subsequent clarification from dochelp@microsoft.com
    the MS-WSP specification document was found to be incorrect.
    
    CPMCreateQueryIn
          |
          ---> CSortSet
    
    should instead eventually point to CSortSet via the following msg structure

    Make sure pid_t is defined.
    
    Just as we include <windows.h> on Windows to get HANDLE defined, include
    <sys/types.h> on UN*X to get pid_t defined.
    
    We don't seem to need this (yet) on the master and 2.2 branches, but it
    looks as if it might be necessary on the 2.0 branch.  Do it everywhere.

    make sure we invalidate our file handle so that instead of printing
    
      "Error reading from pipe: The operation completed successfully. (error 0)"
    
    we show the more useful
    
      "Capturing from a pipe doesn't support pcapng format."

    Fix decoding of T.30 over T.38.
    
    In change 9bcac48403de9aff6435d0f48028ae1f72f64528, "t30.hdlc" was
    inadvertently changed to "t30.hdlc""rtp"; this meant that we didn't
    actually find the T.30 dissector, as we were looking for it under the
    name "t30.hdlcrtp".

    This got lost as part of change 9132706b2dca67c4991edf0f3779d1d43d4b3f65
    - that removed the explicit registering, with a port number, in the
    tcp.port and udp.port dissector tables, *without* replacing it with a
    dissector_add_for_decode_as() registering it *without* a port number.

    Qt: Preference editor improvements.
    
    Use correct disconnect() signature to ensure everything is disconnected
    before connecting new signals.  Without this all previous connects() are
    still active.  This leads to gradually more and more syntax checks being
    called for each change, and possibility of a wrong syntax check
    (especially for strings which has no syntax check).
    
    Use the textEdited() signal to trigger a syntax check at startup.
    This gives consistency.
    
    Do not clear preferenceLineEdit when done because it looks weird when
    the preference text disappears while the widget is hiding.  The entry
    is cleared before next show anyway.

    prefs: Preserve UTF-8 characters in preferences.
    
    When saving preferences the strings in string lists must not be

    Because this strings only should use printable characters we manually
    escape quote and backslash, and skip non-printable.
