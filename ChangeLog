commit f975c17
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>

    Don't worry about initializing auto aggregates with non-constant values.
    
    On UN*X, you can get C99-or-later compilers, and we request that in the
    autoconf script, so it's really a requirement.
    
    At least as I read
    
            https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/34h23df8%28v=vs.100%29.aspx
    
    Visual Studio 2010 (and earlier, going back to VS .NET 2003) supports
    the "Use of block-scope variables initialized with nonconstant
    expressions", with an example of an aggregate (array) initialization
    involving function calls, so it sounds as if it's available on Windows
    with any version of VS that we support.
    
    (If I've missed something, it'll presumably show up when something is
    built with MSVC, and we can update this at that point.)
    
    So the only thing to avoid is initializing global or static variables
    with a value that has to be evaluated at run time (the ability to do
    that is probably present in most environments, as I think C++
    constructors for variables with static storage duration might have to be
    evaluated before main() is called, but I guess few C compilers bother to
    use it).
    
    Expand the example in the hopes of avoiding confusion between "static
    storage duration" (which something declared "static" has, but which
    anything declared with file scope, whether declared "static" or not,
    also has) and "static storage duration and internal linkage", which is
    what the "static" keyword specifies.

Date:   Tue Jun 27 14:35:20 2017 -0700

    Fix the "don't initialize with non-constant variables" item.
    
    It only applies to variables with static storage duration, i.e. global
    and static variables.  Expand the example of how to do it, to make it a
    bit clearer.

Date:   Mon Jun 26 21:03:01 2017 -0700

    On UN*X, make sure we can find inflate() in libz.
    
    For example, on at least some versions of Fedora, if you have a 64-bit
    machine, have both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the run-time zlib
    package installed, and have only the *32-bit* version of the zlib
    development package installed, it'll find the header, and think it can
    use zlib, and will use it in subsequent tests, but it'll try and link
    64-bit test programs with the 32-bit library, causing those tests to
    falsely fail.  Hilarity ensues.

Date:   Mon Jun 26 18:48:01 2017 -0700

    Don't check for inflatePrime() on Windows.
    
    On Windows, we build libz as part of the Wireshark build process, so we
    don't necessarily *have* a libz library to search or inflatePrime() at
    this point; the search fails on the buildbots, for example.
    
    So, on Windows, we just assume we have a new enough version of libz, so
    that it has inflatePrime().

    Lua: Add "tonumber" method to NSTime
    
    Absolute and Relative time fields could not be converted to seconds
    without converting to string and parsing to number.
    
    Fixed conversion in generated code that was subject to precision loss
    
    Usage:
    f=Field.new("frame.delta_time")
    delta=f().value:tonumber()

    Qt: fix sorting of custom columns with multiple fields
    
    Fields like "dns.time || http.time || smb.time" were sorted by column
    number before. Recognize when all fields are numeric values and then try
    to sort by number and otherwise fallback to a value comparison.
    
    In theory sorting should now also be a bit faster for custom columns
    because the columnn type is looked up once.

    Do not process UI events while reading from live capture
    
    For at least Qt, the main_window_update callback is not necessary to
    make the stop button work. When restarting a live capture during a
    flood (via Ctrl-R), this callback actually results in an infinite loop
    in MainWindow::captureStop since the capture state never changes from
    FILE_READ_IN_PROGRESS.
    
    Remove this callback to ensure that the problematic
    pipeActivated / sync_pipe_input_cb / capture_input_new_packets /
    main_window_update / ... / on_actionCaptureRestart_triggered /
    testCaptureFileClose / captureStop sequence is avoided.
    
    Even though captureStop invokes capture_stop, I guess that this does not
    change the state because the pipeActivated callback is already active.

commit 51c57ce
Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Mon Jun 12 14:23:32 2017 +0200

    Qt: fix hang on exiting Qt while loading capture file
    
    testCaptureFileClose can also be invoked while reading an existing
    capture file (the original comment only applied to GTK+, not Qt). When
    the user quits Wireshark while reading an offline pcap, this could
    result in a confusing "Unsaved packets" dialog. Fix this by checking the
    actual capture session state.
    
    After fixing this, the next issue is that cf_close trips on an assertion
    ("cf->state != FILE_READ_IN_PROGRESS"). To address this problem, do not
    close the capture file immediately, but signal to the reader (cf_read)
    that this should be done (similar to the quit logic in GTK+).

    where <Tag> is the value of sys.winver. Newer versions of python add "-32"
    and "-64" to the version in order to allow side by side installations.
    Adjust LocatePythonExecutable accordingly.

    If it doesn't exist, just try reading the global color filter file.
    
    If *that* exists but can't be opened, fail and return a failure

    export-smb2-objects: Make sure tap be called for named pipe
    
    smb2_eo_tap is not called when smb2 packets are dissected as
    named pipe then exit. Basically, for the following code snippet,
    
    if (length) {
            int old_offset = offset;
            ...
            offset = dissect_file_data_smb2_pipe(...);
            if (offset != oldoffset) {
                    /* managed to dissect pipe data */
                    return offset;
            ...
    
    dissect_file_data_smb2_pipe() always returns a different offset,
    thus it will never hit the smb2_eo_tap related code below that
    are needed for exporting smb2 objects.
    
    As a quick fix, call the tap related code before returning.

    We add the message length to the tree as big endian but we interpret it
    as little endian for our further calculations. This causes parsing
