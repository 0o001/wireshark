commit e6b8eec
Author: Jesse Gross <jesse@nicira.com>
Date:   Fri Apr 24 18:49:31 2015 -0700

    Fix filtering on IP heuristic subdissectors.
    
    The IP dissector passes 'tree' to its heuristic dissectors instead
    of the 'parent_tree' passed to the normally registered dissectors.
    These two are generally the same except that 'tree' is set to NULL
    in cases where IP is not referenced - a local optimization that
    should not be passed down to the lower layers. The result is that
    the filter:
    ip && PROTO matches
    but:
    PROTO does not match.
    
    This changes the two types of dissectors to behave the same by
    getting 'parent_tree'.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Apr 20 00:13:55 2015 -0700

    Simplify the calculation of the time stamp.
    
    The time is calculated based on a 32-bit "seconds since the Epoch" value
    for the start time and a 32-bit delta from that time, in milliseconds.
    We can just split that delta into seconds and milliseconds, add the
    seconds to the start time to get the seconds part of the time stamp, and
    multiply the milliseconds by 1,000,000 to get the nanoseconds part of
    the time stamp.  The only 64-bit arithmetic needed is adding the seconds
    to a 64-bit version of the start time (just in case seconds+start time
    goes past Y2.038K).

    Calculate *Peek tagged timestamps in fixed-point.
    
    Add a variant of filetime_to_nstime() that takes a value that's like a
    FILETIME but in units of nanoseconds rather than tenths of a
    microsecond, and use that.  (It looks as if they might just get FILETIME
    values from the OS and multiply them by 100, as the nanosecond-FILETIME
    values appear to be multiples of 100 in the captures I've seen, but they
    might have chosen nanosecond resolution in case they need to support a
    higher-resolution time stamp source, so we don't assume that the values
    will always be a multiple of 100.)

    (We don't use CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD for many things, so it's probably not
    worth making a lot of effort to throw all the warning flags into it if
    we're cross-compiling; we *do* throw them in for native compilation,
    which is what most developers use and test with, so that should be
    sufficient to let the warnings catch problems with the build tools we're

    Keep a captured-packet count in a capture_session and use that.
    
    Have the count in a cfile_t structure always reflect the actual number
    of packets that have been read from the file, rather than, when doing a
    non-update-list-of-packets-in-real-time capture, falsely increasing the
    count in the cfile_t to reflect the number of packets captured but not
    yet read.
    
    Have the status bar base its captured-packet count on the count in the
    capture_session structure, and base the "sorry, no packets were
    captured" message on the count in the capture_session structure, as
    we're no longer using the count in the cfile_t structure to count
    anything in the process of a non-update-list-of-packets-in-real-time
    capture.
    
    That way, we preserve the invariant that the "frames" member of a
    cfile_t will be non-null if the "count" member is non-zero, fixing bug
    6217.
    
    It also means we can get rid of cf_set_packet_count(), as we only set
    the count in the capture-file-reading code.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Apr 6 01:01:03 2015 -0700

    Show a list of interfaces on the welcome screen when capturing.
    
    In a non-update-list-of-packets-in-real-time capture, once the capture
    starts, put up a message on the welcome screen indicating on what
    interfaces we're capturing, rather than leaving the "waiting for stuff
    to arrive from dumpcap" message up.
    
    Make some routines not used outside main_welcome.c static while we're at
    it.

    Have a common routine for constructing strings listing interfaces.
    
    We have a bunch of duplicated code to make those lists; make a common
    routine for that.  (dumpcap currently doesn't use it, as the routine in
    question uses a routine in libui, which dumpcap doesn't use.  We should
    probably fix that.)

    802.11: EAPOL 4-way handshake information wrong
    
    the EAPOL Key Exchange descriptions show key packets 2 and 4 as "Key (Message 4 of 4)"
    
    Reason of issue :
     In the IEEE 802.11 specification the value for the counter is defined as following:
    Message #2 - counter = n
    Message #4 - counter = n+1
    So the only way to distinguish between message #2 and message #4 using the counter value would be for Wireshark to "look ahead" and compare the counter values (e.g., if counter1 < counter2, then message 2, else message 4).
    
    Fix :
    However, there is a much easier way to distinguish between message #2 and message #4.  Instead of using the counter field, Wireshark could parse the "WPA Key Nonce" field (display filter = wlan_rsna_eapol.keydes.nonce).
    According to the IEEE specification, sections 11.6.6.3 and 11.6.6.5 define the value for the WPA Key Nonce as following:
    Message #2, Key Nonce = SNonce (Supplicant Nonce)
    Message #4, Key Nonce = 0
    So, the logic would be:
    1. Use the Wireshark parser to determine the WPA Key Nonce value.  The Key nonce field is 32 octets.
    2. If !(keynonce), then message #2
        Else message #4
    (Only check the first 4 octets of nonce if equal to zero)

    Work around a Linux bonding driver bug (and the lack of a libpcap workaround).
    
    The bonding driver does not properly handle unknown ioctls; it returns
    ENODEV rather than ENOTSUP, EOPNOTSUPP, ENOTTY, or a "not supported"
    error of that type.  This causes problems detailed in bug 11058.
    
    On Linux, check for bonding devices before checking for monitor-mode
    support.
    
    While we're at it, get rid of a commented-out include of
    CheckCSourceCompiles (it's presumably already been implicitly included
    by other functions that use it).

    Have that code check to make sure the DLT_ value in question is actually
    supported by the device; if not, pick the first supported DLT_ value, if
    any; this keeps it from, for example, picking a bad DLT_ value if your
    defaults were set based on monitor mode being on but monitor mode
    actually being off, or vice versa.

    tcp_analysis::base_seq could be set several times when the

    Fix buffer overflow in 802.11 decryption
    
    The sha1 function outputs a multiple of 20 bytes while the ptk buffer
    has only a size of 64 bytes. Follow the hint in 802.11i-2004, page 164
    and use an output buffer of 80 octets.
    
    Noticed when running Wireshark with ASAN, on exit it would try to free a
    "next" pointer which was filled with sha1 garbage. It probably got
    triggered via 3f8fbb734915aaf74eb006898e8fabb007afbf48 which made
    AirPDcap responsible for managing its own memory.

    websocket: avoid recursion, use tcp_dissect_pdus
    
    Use tcp_dissect_pdus to handle reassembly and avoid a recursion in
    dissect_websocket. The HTTP dissector is modified to preserve
    desegmentation functionality (tested with the capture from bug 8448).
    
    As tcp_dissect_pdus is used now, the workaround for bug 8448 can be
    removed and the actual frame dissection logic becomes simpler (the
    length is checked in get_websocket_frame_length).

commit 603878e
Author: Stig Bjørlykke <stig@bjorlykke.org>
Date:   Thu Nov 6 11:19:25 2014 +0100

    Improved deregistering fields.
    
    This improvement avoids use of deallocated memory (crash) if using a
    deregistered field in display filter, color filter, custom column and
    other cases when the field is used as "interesting field".
    
    This functionality is currently used in http, imf and ldap preferences.
