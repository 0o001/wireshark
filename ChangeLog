    netscaler: fix multiple out-of-bounds reads.
    
    Multiple bugs have been found in the provided bug. Some of them have
    been fixed in gefe920a, others here. The main problem is when malformed
    files give wrong lenghts to the code, that casts and dereference it
    without checking, causing oob reads. The fix introduces a check function
    that prevents to go beyond the limits, early returning with a malformed
    file message.
    
    Other bugs have been fixed by forcing the string terminator that allows
    the use of strlen() and MIN() that prevent wrong reads.

commit 8aae8b9ee4
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sat Feb 23 11:21:06 2019 -0800

    Fix liblzma, liblz4, and libssh builds with minimum deployment version and SDK.
    
    liblzma is used by libxml2, which is used by libwireshark, so we need
    it.  It's build by xz, so we need to do the xz build with the
    minimum-version and SDK flags.
    
    liblz4 does its builds in its own unique way; it appears we need to set
    MOREFLAGS to include the relevant flas.
    
    libssh is built with CMake, so you have to do special magic to set the
    SDK path; do it by running cmake with the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET and
    SDKROOT environment variables.

    Fix crash when using the "matches" operator on non-UTF-8 data
    
    GRegex is a thin wrapper around PCRE. Inputs (patterns and subjects) are
    assumed to be UTF-8 by default (unless G_REGEX_RAW is set). If the
    subject is not valid UTF-8, normally pcre_exec will immediately return a
    failure. However, as GLib sets PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK when G_REGEX_RAW is
    given, pcre_exec() will skip the safety check and crash instead.
    
    Fix this by always assuming raw byte patterns. Regression risk: patterns
    such as `ö.ï` will no longer match `öñï` since `ñ` is a multi-byte
    sequence. Patterns such as `(GET|POST) /` remain functional though.

    Use find_or_create_conversation().
    
    2.4 doesn't have find_conversation_pinfo(), but it does have
    find_or_create_conversation().

    Qt: Restore column width and visibility when switching profiles
    
    In some cases the column width and/or hidden setting is not correctly applied
    when switching between profiles having different hidden settings.
    
    Unhiding the column before applying width and hidden setting fixes this issue.

    Also check whether we have nothing but DLCI bytes.
    
    The two failure modes are 1) no byte has the low-order bit set, so we
    didn't even find the end of the DLCI or 2) the byte at the end of the
    packet has the low-order bit set, so that it's all DLCI with no control
    byte after it.

    Check whether you've hit the end of the packet data before going further.
    
    If we found no bytes with the low-order bit set in the packet data,
    there's no point in checking the non-existent "next" byte to see if it's
    a HDLC-style UI control byte (0x03).

Date:   Tue Jan 29 12:02:02 2019 -0800

    Once we've identified a TCP segment as rpcap, use rpcap for the connection.
    
    One reason to use Wireshark is to diagnose protocol errors, so don't,
    for example, treat too-short packets, in a TCP connection where we've
    already seen rpcap packets, as not being rpcap packets.  (Yes, that *is*
    a bug, in the libpcap master, that I found and fixed.)
