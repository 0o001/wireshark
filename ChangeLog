    Just use tvb_memeql() to check the signature.
    
    That's one of the things it's intended to do - check the values of parts
    of the packet that might not actually be there.  The comparison fails if
    either 1) it's all there and doesn't match or 2) it's not all there.

    Fix stripping of binaries.
    
    Instead of using the never-defined $binpath (undefined going back to at
    least Wireshark 1.0.0 - is it a leftover from the Inkscape version?),
    use $bundle_binary_list, to strip all the executables with strip -ur.
    
    (Not that we want to strip anything - we don't even want the debugging
    symbols stripped! - but for cleanliness.)

    Check for dependencies in all subdirectories of $pkglib and $pkgexec.
    
    Just use "find" to find plain files under $pkglib and $pkgexec; this
    avoids trying to run otool on directories, which can cause it to stop

    on the Qt frameworks in subdirectories under $pkglib.
    
    Add a comment giving more details about the big command to find

    CMake: Try to avoid Strawberry Perl's xsltproc.
    
    Search for Chocolatey's and Cygwin's respective xsltprocs before searching
    %PATH%. Strawberry Perl doesn't include DocBook, which makes it useless
    as far as we're concerned.
    
    Another approach would be to look in various locations for an XML catalog
    files and set %XML_CATALOG_FILES%. However, Cygwin's /etc/xml/catalog
    contains Cygwin-specific URLs, e.g. file:///etc/xml/docbook and can't
    be used with a non-Cygwin xsltproc.

    Do the maximum block size check in pcap_read_block().
    
    Do it before we even *try* to read the block, so that it's done in one
    place rather than having to be done in every routine to handle
    particular block types.
    
    The check was missing in the routine to read sysdig event blocks, so if
    we got a huge sysdig even block we'd try to allocate a huge amount of
    memory.

    The data for an address is *not* guaranteed to be aligned on any
    particular boundary, so, for IPv4 addresses, don't assume it's aligned
    on a 32-bit boundary - copy it with memcpy() and use the result of the
    copy.
    
    For IPv6 addresses, cast the data pointer to a pointer to a *const*
    struct e_in6_addr, so we don't throw away constness.
