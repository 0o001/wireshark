    Qt: Don't change the UAT tree visibility when resizing

    It's not necessary to change the visibility of the UAT tree view
    when resizing the columns to the contents, and setting the visiblity
    to false has the side effect of making any editor that is still
    open not editable.

    This mostly affects the PathSelectionEdit used by directory and file
    names, which pass updates to the UAT after each character entered,
    instead of only after pressing Enter. (The UAT code does validation,
    but some widgets do their own validation too.)

    This prevents having to click in the editor after each character
    when entering directories or filenames.

    Qt: ATapDataModel rows don't have children

    Our ATapDataModel is table based, and the rows don't have children.
    It's displayed in a TrafficTree, which inherits from QTreeView, however,
    which allows the possibility that rows have children.

    Make sure that rowCount returns 0 if handed a valid parent QModelIndex.

    See:
    https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qabstractitemmodel.html#rowCount

    We don't call rowCount with a valid index directly in our code, but some
    of the Qt code can do so, for example QTreeView::expandRecursively() if
    an Asterisk is pressed.

    RTP Player: Improve sync of audible sound with waveform on Qt 6.x

    I noticed that when same sound is played over and over on Qt 6.x, first
    play is in sync with waveform, but later replays are delayed.
    It looks that Qt 6.x returns different timer value in outputNotify() for
    first and subsequent replays.
    The fix handles this better than before.

    LISP: Don't go past a LCAF payload length

    The LISP Canonical Address Format has a payload length indicator.
    Use that to create a payload tvb and don't dissect outside the
    payload length. With fuzzed and malformed packets, this was causing
    the same bytes to be dissected many times, particularly in the
    recursive address types.

    A LCAF would be dissected outside the payload region, but then
    elsewhere the offset was only advanced by the payload length.

    RPCoRDMA: Frame end cleanup for global write offsets

    Add a frame end routine for a global which is assigned to packet
    scoped memory. It really should be made proto data, but is used
    in a function in the header (that doesn't take the packet info
    struct as an argument) and this fix needs to be made in stable
    branches.

    editcap: always close the dump file, if we have one, before exiting.

    The file might need to have some writes done after all packets have been
    written, in order to make the file valid, so, if we get an error from
    wtap_dump() or process_new_idbs(), close the dump file after reporting
    the error.  Don't report an error if the close fails - we've already
    reported one problem.

    In addition, always free up filename, and frames_user_comments, before
    exiting, if there's anything to be freed.

    While we're at it, fix a comment - in English, they're called "packets",
    not "packages".

    the double-escaping will cause quotes, angle brackets, etc. to
    look like HTML entities.
