commit 5f7ba271ec
Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Mon Dec 31 14:07:32 2018 +0100

    wsutil: fix crash due to corruption of the "small_buffers" array
    
    Gracefully handle repeated calls of ws_buffer_free on the same buffer to
    avoid strange crashes in other new users that allocate a "small" buffer.
    
    The first call to ws_buffer_free would store data pointer in the
    'small_buffers' array for reuse and set the pointer to NULL. Result:
    
        (gdb) p cfile.rec.options_buf
        $2 = {
          data = 0x0,
          allocated = 2048,     // Oops, not modified!
          start = 0,
          first_free = 0
        }
    
    All users of Buffer (including ws_buffer_free) however asssume that
    'allocated' reflects the actual size of 'data'. If this is not the case
    (if ws_buffer_free is called again), then a data pointer (NULL!) will be
    stored and the next ws_buffer_init request for a "small buffer" will
    result in unexpected behavior (including crashes).
    
    Fix the issue by clearing the 'allocated' field as well. Add assertions
    to catch such issues earlier rather than crashing at random users of
    these buffers (such as frame_tvbuff).

    Qt: Open our preference dialogs via "clicked" signals.
    
    In ModulePreferencesScrollArea we create QPushButtons that open modal
    UAT and file dialogs. Open them via the "clicked" signal instead of
    the "pressed" signal. "clicked" is a general activation signal that
    fires after the mouse button has been clicked+released or a keyboard
    event. "pressed" fires before "released" and can be problematic in
    some cases.

Date:   Sat Mar 3 19:49:22 2018 +0100

    enip: use wmem for copied addresses
    
    When we copy an address from pinfo into connInfo->O2T.ipaddress, a
    shallow copy is not sufficient. connInfo->O2T.ipaddress is kept across
    packets whereas pinfo is valid only for the current packet.
    
    Use wmem with file scope for the copied address. This fixes a
    use-after-free error when we access the address in a subsequent packet.

    We don't need it and, if there *is* no pcap.h header, because the pcap
    headers aren't installed, it won't compile.
