    RTS_FLAG_NONE is a flags field value, but it's not a flag bit.
    
    It's the *absence* of flag bits, so you can't test whether it's set;
    don't have a field for it.  This gets rid of a dissector assertion.
    
    Add some more URLs for information about DCE RPC and MS-RPC.

    On UN*X, st_ctime is the last status change time, not the creation time.
    
    That's the time the file's inode last changed, so size changes,
    permission changes, etc. affect it.  It's *not* the time the file was
    created; most UN*Xes don't provide that.  Newer versions of FreeBSD,
    NetBSD, OpenBSD, and macOS do, but other UN*Xes don't appear to.
    
    On Windows, at least according to Microsoft's documentation, st_ctime
    *is* the creation time.  Hopefully that's not the result of confusion on
    the part of somebody at Microsoft.

commit 698f6ca

Date:   Fri Oct 21 19:18:15 2016 -0700

    More checks for localtime() and gmtime() returning NULL.
    
    And some comments in the case where we're converting the result of
    time() - if your machine's idea of time predates January 1, 1970,
    00:00:00 UTC, it'll crash on Windows, but that's not a case where a
    *file* can cause the problem due either to a bad file time stamp or bad
    time stamps in the file.

    localtime() can return NULL, even if it's unlikely.
    
    ANSI C says it can return NULL - and, at least on Windows with the MSVC
    library, it *will* return null for dates prior to the Epoch.  Check for
    a null return and handle it.
    
    Fixes CID 1374109.
