    Have dissect_7bit_string() return a const gchar *.
    
    Nobody needs to modify the string, and nobody needs to free it - which
    is good, because it could be a string constant which can neither be
    modified nor freed.

Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Wed Sep 13 21:19:38 2017 -0400

    Allow distinction between bitmasked 32bit and 64bit unsigned integers in proto_tree_set_representation_value.
    
    IS_FT_UINT includes both 32 and 64 bit unsigned integers, but fvalue_get_uinteger
    only allows 32-bit values, so add IS_FT_UINT32 macro for distinguishing between
    using fvalue_get_uinteger and fvalue_get_uinteger64.
    
    All other cases that use fvalue_get_uinteger vs fvalue_get_uinteger64 are done
    first with switch statements and don't rely on IS_FT_UINT to distinguish
    between 32 and 64 bit values
