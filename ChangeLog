commit 9a7abcc
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Thu Sep 11 13:29:37 2014 -0700

    Add some additional checks in SnifferDecompress().
    
    Check the input pointer in the while clause of the loop, so that we
    handle an empty input buffer.
    
    When reading a bit mask, check before fetching the bit mask that we have
    two bytes of bit mask and the byte after it.
    
    Before putting an uncompressed input byte into the output, make sure we
    wouldn't run past the end of the output buffer.
    
    Before copying an earlier string from the output buffer, make sure it
    doesn't run past the end of the data we've decompressed so far.

    Don't print the packet counter when capturing if we're also printing
    packet information to a terminal (which we assume is the same terminal
    as the one to which the packet counts are being printed), as they get in
    the way of each other.
    
    Don't print it if we're sending the standard error to a terminal, or if
    -q is specified, either.
    
    Put all the setting of print_packet_counts together; it looks as if the
    default value of print_packet_counts may have been changed to TRUE and
    the code to handle -q wasn't changed to set it to FALSE if -q was
    specified rather than setting it to TRUE if it wasn't specified.

    Increase the error buffer size for rpcap.
    
    If the rpcap port is unreachable pcap_findalldevs_ex can write more
    than PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE bytes to errbuf. E.g. if we try to capture from
    Google's all-eights public DNS server we get:
    
    ----
    Can't get list of interfaces: Is the server properly installed on 8.8.8.8?
    connect() failed: A connection attempt failed because the connected
    party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established
    connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.  (code 1
    ----
    
    Set the buffer to PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE*4 bytes. Hopefully that's large enough.

    0 returned from an open routine is not an error; don't provide an error.
    
    If we return 0 from an open routine, we should not set err and should
    not return an error message through err_info; it just means "this isn't
    one of our files", which is *NOT* an error.

    This will, at least, make it show up as the meaning of a field

    At least partially addresses bug 10382, and fully addresses it if it's

    backport.
