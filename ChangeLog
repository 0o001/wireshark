    Qt: Remove the capture information dialog checkbox.
    
    Remove the "Show extra capture information dialog" checkbox from the
    capture options dialog. That dialog will be in 3.0, but the checkbox
    doesn't do anything other than toggle the capture.show_info preference
    in 2.0 to 2.6.

Date:   Sun May 13 15:01:54 2018 +0200

    Q.931: fix use-after-free (write) of "q931_pi"
    
    The dissect_q931_number_ie (and indirectly dissect_q931_cause_ie_unsafe)
    write to the "q931_pi" structure which seems private to the q931
    dissector, but can in fact be called through other dissectors (isup) as
    well. Normally this structure is initialized in "dissect_q931_pdu" and
    invalidated at the end of the function, but a malformed packet can
    prevent the cleanup. In the next packet, a different dissector can thus
    trigger a use-after-free via "dissect_q931_number_ie".
    
    Rename "dissect_q931_cause_ie_unsafe" since "unsafe" meant that external
    dissectors could not call it directly (see commit a83a87e9ca).
    
    Based on commit 197ceddab109, it seems that the intended purpose of the
    structure is to provide information to the VoIP Calls dialog, but it
    would only be used when called through dissect_q931_pdu. Dissectors like
    isup have their own routines to provide call information, but as a
    side-effect of code sharing the problematic code path was reached.

    Fix function declaration of ws_buffer_length().
    
    This makes it match 1) the way the function is defined, if it is defined
    and 2) the type returned if it's a macro, not a function.

    LDSS: Fix a read overrun in dissect_ldss_transfer.
    
    dissect_ldss_transfer had a trivial read overrun: "line" was not
    NUL-terminated, and strtol/g_ascii_strtoull will keep reading and discarding
    any leading whitespace, so a malformed LDSS packet (with only whitespace
    characters following the tag on a "Size:"/"Start:"/"Compression:" line) could
    trigger a read overrun.
    
    Let's replace the tvb_memdup with tvb_get_string_enc, which does some checking
    of the input characters (which, it seems, must always be ASCII), and produces a
    neat NUL-terminated string.
    
    Testing Done: On Linux x64, ran "valgrind tshark -r fuzz-2018-04-23-14422.pcap"
       without the fix (to reproduce the failure), and then with the fix, and
       observed that no errors were reported anymore after the fix. 60,000 iters of
       fuzz-test with ldss_filtered.pcap as input, plus 1,000 iters under valgrind.
       Launched wireshark and opened ldss_filtered.pcap, and examined the dissection
       of the "ldss and tcp" packets; All looks good.
