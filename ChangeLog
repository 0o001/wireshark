    LISP: Don't go past a LCAF payload length

    The LISP Canonical Address Format has a payload length indicator.
    Use that to create a payload tvb and don't dissect outside the
    payload length. With fuzzed and malformed packets, this was causing
    the same bytes to be dissected many times, particularly in the
    recursive address types.

    A LCAF would be dissected outside the payload region, but then
    elsewhere the offset was only advanced by the payload length.

    RPCoRDMA: Frame end cleanup for global write offsets

    Add a frame end routine for a global which is assigned to packet
    scoped memory. It really should be made proto data, but is used
    in a function in the header (that doesn't take the packet info
    struct as an argument) and this fix needs to be made in stable
    branches.

    editcap: always close the dump file, if we have one, before exiting.

    The file might need to have some writes done after all packets have been
    written, in order to make the file valid, so, if we get an error from
    wtap_dump() or process_new_idbs(), close the dump file after reporting
    the error.  Don't report an error if the close fails - we've already
    reported one problem.

    In addition, always free up filename, and frames_user_comments, before
    exiting, if there's anything to be freed.

    While we're at it, fix a comment - in English, they're called "packets",
    not "packages".

    The is_v2 argument to netmon_dump_open() is a Boolean, with FALSE
    meaning "not v2" and TRUE meaning "v2", not a version number.  Don't
    pass a version number, as that causes both v1 and v2 to be treated as
    v2.

    a crash in this branch.)
