commit c83d2ad8bb
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Nov 11 12:31:08 2019 -0800

    Don't report EPIPE errors writing out packet information.
    
    EPIPE almost certainly means "the next program after us in the pipeline
    exited before we were finished writing", so this isn't a real error, it
    just means we're done.  (We don't get SIGPIPE because libwireshark
    ignores SIGPIPE to avoid getting killed if writing to the MaxMind
    process gets SIGPIPE because that process died.)
    
    Presumably either that program exited deliberately (for example, "head
    -N" read N lines and printed them), in which case there's no error to
    report, or it terminated due to an error or a signal, in which case
    *that's* the error and that error has been reported.
    
    (We don't do that for EINVAL, as that's presumably a real error.  It
    shows up on Windows in bug 16192, but what we probably want to do there
    is to, on Windows, use _doserrno, check for the equivalent Windows
    errors, and, for the default case, convert _doserrno to the appropriate
    string, using Windows APIs, and report *that* string; the MS C library
    converts a whole bunch of Windows errors to EINVAL, thus losing
    information and making it harder to determine what the real error is.
    
    Therefore, I'm just marking this with Ping-Bug, as it's only fixing the
    problem on UN*Xes.)

    SNMP: handle Net-SNMP Engine Id of 12 octets
    
    The Net-SNMP code creates an Engine Id size based on the compilation
    size, either 8 or 12 octets long. The initial change added handling of
    the '4B/8B random, 4B epoch seconds' format. A different format seems
    more likely though, hence this change, implementing handling of the
    '4B random, 4B/8B epoch seconds' format instead.
