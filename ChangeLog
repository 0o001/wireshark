       Currently supported subdissectors are Ethernet and IP.
    
    2. Implement multiple "flavors" of PCLI with different header formats:
            pcli: 4 byte CCCID
            pcli8: 8 byte header (including CCCID)
            pcli12: 4 byte CCCID, 8 byte NTP timestamp
            pcli20: 4 byte CCCID, 8 byte NTP timestamp, 8 byte case ID
       All flavors currently using "Decode As" for payload.
    
    3. Optionally append CCCID to protocol item in tree
       using preference "pcli.summary_in_tree".
    
    4. Obsolete preference "pcli.udp_port".

    Qt: Add option to back white line separator for packet list items
    
    This uses one line (on bottom) of items and makes it white.
    Seen in Wireshark on some configurations of GTK 2 on Linux,
    so backports it to Qt for people who like it.
    
    In my opinion it helps if you use packet list background colors
    for frames and you have a lot of following frames with
    the same background color.

    Fix escaping of strings in UATs.
    
    Not only must characters that aren't printable ASCII characters be
    escaped, backslashes must be escaped (as backslash is an escape
    introducer) and double-quotes must be escaped (as double-quotes
    encapsulate strings).
    
    When constructing a string to hand to uat_load_str(), escape pathnames,
    as they are likely to contain backslashes on Windows, could contain
    backslashes on UN*X, and could contain quotes on UN*X and possibly
    Windows.  (Arguably, we should escape all the string arguments

    Require dissectors for all ONC RPC calls and replies.
    
    Either there's a known body for the call or reply, in which case we
    already have a dissector for it, or the body is empty, in which case we
    now have dissect_rpc_void() to dissect it, or the body is unknown or
    nobody's bothered writing it, in which case we use dissect_rpc_unknown()
    for now.
    
    This means that an attempt to look up the dissector for a known
    procedure will always succeed, so we can label it with the name rather
    than with "proc-N".
    
    It also means that we distinguish between "it's void" and "it's
    unknown", so that unknown values will get flagged as such.

    Also add parameter to heur_dissector_add() for the "default" enable/disable of a heuristic dissector. With this parameter, a few more (presumably weak) heuristic dissectors have been "registered" but of course default to being disabled.

    Add new long options to GUIs to allow arbitrary protocols and heuristics to be disabled via command-line
    
    Future: Allow multiple protocols to be disabled in one option statement
    (perhaps using a comma or colon delmited set of names in <proto_name>)
    instead of having to specify --disable-protocol <proto_name> multiple times.

    Bluetooth: RFCOMM: Replace Decode by Channel by DLCI
    
    Channel is not enough to decode streams over RFCOMM. DLCI is.
    DLCI is Channel and Direction bit that can be used to recognize
    which side RFCOMM service (channel) is - remote or local side.
    Direction bit is first bit in DLCI so: DLCI = Channel < 1 | Direction.

    Draw packet colors in the packet list scrollbar.
    
    Inspired by (but not as fancy as) Packet Fence, an enhancement written
    for Ethereal a loooong time ago by Martin Visser:
    
    https://www.wireshark.org/lists/ethereal-dev/200011/msg00122.html
    
    Several text editors call this a "minimap".
    
    Color each scrollbar raster line to match the color of up to 7 packets.
    Note in the comments why this number was chosen.
    
    If we have any flagged frames (marked, ignored, time ref) indicate them
    on either side of the scrolbar.
    
    Handle HiDPI (retina) displays. This means that your window size depends
    on the height of your scrollbar *and* your monitor resolution.
    
    Qt's idea of the slider rect doesn't match up with the slider on OS X.
    This might be local to my build -- I can replicate it Qt Creator.

    RTCP heuristic only matches odd port-number TURN ChannelData packets
    
    RTCP can be carried within TURN CannelData messages, or STUN/TURN Send
    messages. The TURN message can be in UDP or TCP, of any port number (by
    default the even port 3478). So the RTCP heuristic dissector used inside the
    TURN ChannelData/Send payload needs to match regardless of the port number of
    the packet.

    stun/turn: stop STUN heuristic incorrectly matching TURN ChannelData messages
    
    The STUN heuristic dissector decoded a packet as a TURN ChannelData message
    with a relatively weak heuristic. In order to avoid incorrect matches, it
    checked for an existing conversation first, but the UDP layer dissector will
    create a conversation so this check was basically useless.
    
    Therefore, the STUN heuristic dissector no longer matches TURN ChannelData
    messages at all. If it matches another TURN message type, then it sets the
    dissector for the conversation to be the non-heuristic dissector, and then
    ChannelData messages will be decoded by that.
    
    Based on the new heuristic dissector enable/disable model, in the near future
    I might add another heuristic for a weaker check, to include TURN ChannelData.

    On OS X, add an rpath for the Qt frameworks, and remove it in the app bundle.
    
    Qt 5.5 and later have @rpath-based install names for the frameworks,
    which means that, if they're not installed in some frameworks directory
    searched by default (such as /Library/Frameworks) - which is the default
    case with the Qt installer - they won't be found by default.
    
    Add the directory in which the frameworks exist as an rpath in the
    Wireshark binary, so that they'll be found, and then remove it from the
    Wireshark binary in the app bundle, as the directory in which the
    frameworks exist on the machine on which Wireshark was built is
    irrelevant to the machines on which it's being deployed - the frameworks
    are included in the bundle, and we already add an rpath to find them
    there.

    Handle both @rpath/ and absolute paths in Qt framework install names.
    
    When looking for Qt framework dependencies, look for dependencies that
    begin either with @rpath or with the Qt framework directory.
    
    Then, first transform @rpath/ to a path relative to the Qt framework
    directory, and then strip off everything past the framework directory,
    to get the absolute path of the framework directory (not of the
    framework binary - we want to copy the whole framework).
    
    In the loop looking for dependencies on things *other* than Qt
    frameworks, exclude Qt framework references with absolute paths from the
    dependencies we find; they get processed later.  (We already excluded
    those with @rpath paths.)

    described in bug 11324. Call columnsChanged when we, uh, change columns.
    
    Add a sectionMoved slot to handle column reordering.
    
    Don't rebuild the column list when we update the widgets in the column
    preferences frame.  Do enable and disable the "remove" button as needed.
    
    Try to keep the user from removing all of the columns in both the packet
    list and column preferences.
    
    Left as an exercise for the reader: The GTK+ UI also fails when you
    remove all of the columns via the preferences:
    
      packet_list.c:377:packet_list_sort_column: assertion failed: (col)

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Jul 12 19:12:05 2015 -0700

    Make OS X .app bundling work with Qt 5.5.
    
    macdeployqt doesn't actually seem to deploy any of Qt into the app
    bundle, probably because we're using it in a fashion they didn't intend
    (i.e., not doing everything with *their* build tools), so we just extend
    our dependency-binding stuff to handle the Qt libraries, and copy over
    the Qt plugins ourselves.
    
    We also add the rpaths to the executables and libraries as part of the
    app bundle building process; I thought it'd fix macdeployqt's problem,
    but it didn't, however, it's probably cleaner to do it there anyway.

    Make .o files, not .cpp and .h files, depend on the ui_*.h files.
    
    That's one of the mechanisms the autotools documentation suggests using
    to handle generated header files.
    
    Using it means that "make dist" will no longer try to build those files
    (they're not part of the distribution - and they can't be, as the files
    would be different for Qt 4 and Qt 5, and need to be generated by the
    uic from the same version of Qt as the one against which Wireshark is
    being built).
    
    This means we don't need to try to find uic, moc, or rcc if we're not
    building with Qt, so don't do so.

    The flags are now extended to 16 bits to support GBP extension, Group
    Policy Id is on 16 bits, VNI always on 24 bits and remaining bits are reserved.
    The following bits are defined in addition to the existing VXLAN fields:

    Lua: add functions for more field information
    
    Add Lua functions so a plugin can introspect field information, such
    as the type of field, flags, tvb, etc. Also add a couple of Tvb and
    ByteArray methods. And cleanup the TreeItem code a little.

       for each function call.
    
       As part of this change,  the order of certain fixed_field
       functions was changed to fix any forward references.
    
    Also:
       Spelling
       Whitespace

    Qt: Add initial Lua support.
    
    Add a FunnelStatistics class, which is the main interface between the Qt
    UI and the Funnel API.
    
    Add FunnelTextDialog, which implements the text_window, ProgDlg, menu,
    and other routines. Add FunnelStringDialog, which implements dlg_new.
    
    We currently only support "Tools" menu items (MENU_TOOLS_UNSORTED, aka
    REGISTER_TOOLS_GROUP_UNSORTED). Add a disabled placeholder to the
    "Tools" menu in case we don't load any scripts.
    
    Use "struct progdlg" instead of needlessly casting to
    funnel_progress_window_t.
    
    To do:
    - Add support for MENU_STAT_UNSORTED, MENU_STAT_GENERIC, etc.
    - Make the firewall config generator a Lua script?
    - Add FunnelGraphDialog? It seems like it would be useful to
      make QCustomPlot accessible to Lua scripts.

    Revert "diameter: convert some GArrays to epan wmem_arrays"
    
    This reverts commit 59017a22be9a5a86f5c365cc22a2f1e23205597b.
    
    As indicated by Michael on the original change, this breaks
    diameter rather badly for some reason I haven't been able to
    determine. Reverting until I can track down the root cause.

    MySQL: dissector adds packet content to INFO column without scrubbing it
    
    Make the MYSQL protocol dissector scrub the strings from the packet content by
    putting it through format_text() to remove/replace CR, LF, TAB, etc. The
    fields affected are: query string, greeting version string, login username,
    and login schema.

    Clean up a bunch of stuff.
    
    The command byte values aren't FPGA-specific - if they were, the code
    wouldn't have worked.  Provide #defines for the main ones and check for
    them, and use that to determine whether the packet is transmitted or
    received.
    
    Add a bunch of #defines, shuffle some defines to cluster related ones
    together and separate unrelated ones, get rid of duplicate #defines
    (where different FPGAs use the same value).
    
    Fix some typoes.

    Lua: split init/cleanup routines
    
    The epan init routines have been split up into init vs. cleanup, where the
    init routines are only invoked when a file is opened, and the cleanup ones are
    invoked multiple times, such as on a re-scan of packets.
    
    Since the Lua API's Proto.init() callback is supposed to be invoked at both
    init and cleanup times, the wslua code now invokes it in both of epan's init
    and cleanup routines.

    asn1: split off cleanup routines
    
    General approach:
    
     1. Split allocation (e.g. g_hash_table_new) from deallocation
        (g_hash_table_destroy) into functions named "init" and "cleanup".
     2. Remove guards that test whether the hash tables are set as
        init is always called before cleanup.
     3. Remove setting hash tables to NULL after destruction.
     4. Copy register_init_routine function call and change init to cleanup.
     5. Add cleanup function that calls reassembly_table_destroy if there
        is a reassembly_table_init function.
    
    Some templates were modified as follows:
    
     - snmp: split renew into init+cleanup, but keep renew for the uat_new
       callback.
     - ldap,ros: Rename init to cleanup as there was no initialization.
     - camel: remove init function from header, make it static. Remove debug
       print.
     - tcap: remove unused ssn_range assignment.
    
    Files in epan/ were regenerated using cmake && make asn1

    Split four more init routines into init/cleanup
    
    Three of them are trivial movements, the smb-sidsnooping is an odd one.
    Ronnie Sahlberg disabled the sid_name_snooping feature on 9 July 2007.
    There is a preference to override it though... For now add a TODO
    marker and ensure that the hash tables are always initialized.

Date:   Sun Jun 28 16:10:51 2015 -0700

    Split init routine into init/cleanup for more dissectors
    
    This patch converts some dissectors using g_hash_table_foreach_remove.
    
     - 9p: drop no-op free func.
     - nfs: use g_hash_table_new_full such that a destructor function can
       be used. Drop NULL check since g_free can handle these just fine.
     - nlm: use g_hash_table_new_full such that a destructor function can
       be used. Simplify "matched" destruction by replacing the wrapper by
       a direct g_free call.

Date:   Sun Jun 28 16:02:45 2015 -0700

    Call reassembly_table_destroy and move g_hash_table_destroy
    
    This patch moves g_hash_table_destroy calls from the init routine to
    the cleanup routine. Besides that, the conditional check for the hash
    table has been removed, assuming that init is always paired with a
    cleanup call.
    
    If reassembly_table_init is found, a reassembly_table_destroy call is
    prepended to the cleanup function as well.
    
    Comments have been removed from the init function as well as these did
    not seem to have additional value ("destroy hash table" is clear from
    the context).
    
    The changes were automatically generated using
    https://git.lekensteyn.nl/peter/wireshark-notes/diff/one-off/cleanup-rewrite.py?id=4d11f07180d9c115eb14bd860e9a47d82d3d1dcd
    Manually edited files (for assignment auditing): dvbci, ositp, sccp,
    tcp.
    
    Other files that needed special attention due to the use of
    register_postseq_cleanup_routine:
    
     - ipx: keep call, do not add another cleanup routine.
     - ncp: remove empty mncp_postseq_cleanup. mncp_hash_lookup is used
       even if a frame is visited before (see dissect_ncp_common), hence
       the hash table cannot be destroyed here. Do it in cleanup instead.
     - ndps: add cleanup routine to kill reassembly table, but do not
       destroy the hash table as it is already done in ndps_postseq_cleanup.

    Call reassembly_table_destroy for some dissectors
    
    This patch adds reassembly_table_destroy calls as cleanup function for
    dissectors which have a simple init routine that just calls
    reassembly_table_init (comments are ignored).
    
    The changes were automatically generated using

    (with the if and assignment parsers disabled).
    
    The only difference from the autogenerated output is that the XXX
    comments from the init routines in smb-pipe and tds dissectors are kept.

    packet: add cleanup routines support
    
    Currently reassembly tables are not freed on shutdown. This makes
    memleak debugging more difficult due to noise. Support cleanup
    routines that can do smarter things.
    
    After this change, "init" routines are not called anymore when
    closing files. Further changes should split init routines to
    cleanup routines as needed.

    opcua dissector: Fix parsing of 7 byte numeric service NodeIds.
    
    The service NodeIds of OPC UA are normally encoded as 4 byte numeric NodeId.
    However, it is technically also possible to encode these as (less efficient) 7 byte numeric NodeId.
    This kind of NodeId was already implemented, but wrong.
    Since then no one ever used this kind of NodeId for service NodeIds.

    Check that the file is a regular file, while we're at it.  This means we
    don't have to check before opening.

    Try to fix NSIS packaging dependencies.
    
    Split the nsis_package target into nsis_package_prep which has
    dependencies and nsis_package which has no dependencies and as a result
    blindly builds the package. Remove the nsis_uninstaller target since
    that's now handled by nsis_package_prep. Nsis_package_prep *should*
    also take care of the dependencies for portableapps_package, but that
    hasn't been tested.
    
    Update the Developer's Guide.
    
    This requires coordination with the Windows buildbots.

    Fix handling of 11ac radio metadata.
    
    Add more fields to the metadata to handle everything radiotap has, and
    show them.
    
    Call the FEC type field just "FEC", and have it be an integer field with
    0 meaning BCC and 1 meaning LDPC, rather than a Boolean.
    
    11ac doesn't have *an* MCS, it can have up to 4, one per user.
    
    Label the 11ac bandwidth values the same way we do in the radiotap
    dissector.

    copying files from the CMake run dir into the portable apps dir.
    
    The change adds a dependency on nsis_uninstall to the portableapps_package
    target in an attempt to sequence the copy operation.

    wmem: convert tree key to void*
    
    Rather than forcing everything to live in guint32. We still use guints for now
    via the G_POINTER_TO_UINT and vice-versa, but this paves the way in future for
    custom comparison functions which will make e.g. string trees far more
    efficient for long strings.

    Plugin Interface: Add GUI callbacks
    
     Rename ext_menubar to a more appropriate plugin_if.
    
     External menus can be implemented by plugins to present
     additional menus for deep-packet analysis. One side-effect
     of such menus being implemented as plugins is, that they
     are being executed in different threads and therefore can
     only use limited access to the main GUI. Also, there is
     no safe cross-gui (GTK and Qt) way for many features.
    
     This patch implements a first functionality, by which a
     plugin implemented using ext_menubar can apply a display
     filter to the main view.
    
     For now the implementation supports filtering, as well as
     saving a preference.

    atof is locale-dependent. In locales such as Swedish, German and Dutch,

    While at it, make the mate dissector also be independent of locale.
    Blacklist atof in checkAPIs. Lemon is still using strtod, but that is
    not our problem for now.

    qt: fix button state when cancelling save
    
    If the user decides not to capture after all, by hitting cancel when prompted
    for their unsaved changes, we have to manually uncheck the button again because
    Qt helpfully checks it for us.

    Initialize default stats before using them
    
    Quick hack fix for bug 11275.
    
    The longer fix I am still thinking about, but it goes something like this: we
    have a terribly confusing dependency graph in ordering our various preferences,
    so it's fragile and needs refactoring.
    
    1. We must call epan_init before we read the preferences files, since dissectors
    register many preferences.
    2. We must call pre_init_prefs before we call prefs_register_modules, since that
    inits the default values of the "global" preferences structure. `init_prefs()`
    handles this normally.
    3. We must call epan_init before we call init_prefs since init_prefs depends on
    UATs being initialized (which is something epan_init does).
    4. We must call prefs_register_modules before we call epan_init since that
    generates the `protocols` subtree which is needed for registering
    dissector-specific preferences.
    
    The above graph has a cycle, which I *think* can be solved by splitting
    prefs_register_modules?

    Up to know Qt 'Decode As' window was saving manual configuration automatically, contrary to GTK UI.
    This can be misleading when decoding protocols without a fixed identifier (port number, USB bus/device id, ...).
    Opening a new trace might lead to previous and now irrelevant settings being applied.
    Make this optional and add a Save button to permanently store the current configuration.

commit 74c5ab0
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Jun 22 23:59:59 2015 -0700

    Treat channel flags fields as just collections of bits, not as type fields.
    
    The radiotap and PPI specs don't call them type fields, and don't list
    them as having type values, they call them flags fields and list the
    individual bits.
    
    Listing them as type fields is especially confusing with radiotap, as
    you can have multiple fields giving *different* channel types, as per,
    for example
    
        https://ask.wireshark.org/questions/42888/multiple-channel-types-and-mcs-missing
    
    where an 802.11ac packet has one "channel type" field claiming it's
    802.11a and another one claiming it's 802.11n when it is, in fact,
    *neither* 11a *nor* 11n.
    
    If you want to know the channel type, look at the "802.11 radio
    information" tree that comes before the 802.11 header tree; it gives a
    reasonable summary of most of the radio metadata, giving the *correct*
    channel type, and not showing any field multiple times.  Look at the
    radiotap or PPI or... tree only if either 1) you're debugging a driver
    that creates those headers or 2) there's some data in the header that
    *doesn't* show up in any form in the 802.11 radio information tree (in
    which case the code for radio information probably needs to be changed
    to show it).

    prefs: fix memleak
    
    Calling g_list_remove_link(link, llink) does not free the removed
    last link llink. g_list_next or g_list_foreach+g_free followed by
    g_list_free should be used instead such that the data is freed before
    and then dropped from the list.
    
    This fixes a memleak in tshark -r dns.pcap detected by ASAN (single
    packet).
    
    Set pref->default_val.list = NULL just in case, and with symmetry with
    capture_columns handling.

    Provide PHY type and band information in the 802.11 pseudo-header.
    
    Provide that information so that the "802.11 radio information" protocol
    can indicate whether a packet was 802.11 legacy/11b/11a/11g/11n/11ac,
    and possibly whether it's 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz 11n.  (Sometimes the center
    frequency might not be supplied, so the band information can be useful.)
    
    Also, provide some 11ac information, now that we can distinguish between
    11n and 11ac.  Don't calculate the data rate from the MCS index unless
    it's 11n; we don't yet have code to calculate it for 11ac.
    
    For radiotap, only provide guard interval information for 11n and 11ac,
    not for earlier standards.
    
    Handle the 11ac flag in the Peek remote protocol.
    
    For Peek tagged files, the "extension flags" are 11n/11ac flags, so we
    don't have to check for the "MCS used" bit in order to decide that the
    packet is 11n or 11ac or to decide whether to provide the "bandwidth" or
    "short GI" information.

    GSM MAP: Fix decoding of IPv6 addresses
    
    From 3GPP 23.003
    
    The GSN Address is composed of the following elements:
    1) The Address Type, which is a fixed length code (of 2 bits) identifying the type of address that is used in the
    Address field.
    2) The Address Length, which is a fixed length code (of 6 bits) identifying the length of the Address field.
    3) The Address, which is a variable length field which contains either an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address.
    Address Type 0 and Address Length 4 are used when Address is an IPv4 address.
    Address Type 1 and Address Length 16 are used when Address is an IPv6 address.
    The IP v4 address structure is defined in RFC 791 [14].
    The IP v6 address structure is defined in RFC 2373 [15].
    
    Currently the Wireshark decodes IPv6 addresses as IPv4

    Further refactor SRT stats.
    
    Create "common" SRT tap data collection intended for all GUIs.   Refactor/merge functionality of existing dissectors that have SRT support (AFP, DCERPC, Diameter, FC, GTP, LDAP, NCP, RPC, SCIS, SMB, and SMB2) for both TShark and GTK.
    
    SMB and DCERPC "tap packet filtering" were different between TShark and GTK, so I went with GTK filter logic.
    CAMEL "tap packet filtering" was different between TShark and GTK, so GTK filtering logic was pushed to the dissector and the TShark tap was left alone.

Date:   Sat Jun 20 15:57:57 2015 -0700

    Call the "802.11 radio information" dissector for radio headers.
    
    Have dissectors of various forms of radio information headers in the
    packets fill in a struct ieee_802_11_phdr with radio information as
    appropriate, and call the "802.11 radio information" dissector rather
    than the raw 802.11 dissector.
    
    This means that the radio information can be found in a
    protocol-independent and encapsulation-independent form when you're
    looking at the packet; that information can be presented in a form
    somewhat easier to read than the raw metadata header format.
    
    It also enables having a single "radio information" tap that allows
    statistics to handle all different sorts of radio information
    encapsulation.
    
    In addition, it lets us clean up some of the arguments passed to the
    common 802.11 dissector routine, by having it pull that information from
    the struct ieee_802_11_phdr.
    
    Ensure that the right structure gets passed to that routine, and that
    all the appropriate parts of that structure are filled in.
    
    Rename the 802.11 radio protocol to "wlan_radio", rather than just
    "radio", as it's 802.11-specific.  Give all its fields "wlan_radio."
    names rather than "wlan." names.

    Previous code was checking that the string was ASCII, which does not work when
    the recent capture files list contains non ASCII characters

    Pass the 802.11 pseudo-header as an argument.
    
    Rather than accessing it through pinfo->pseudo_header, have it passed as
    an argument.
    
    This means we no longer tweak the pseudo-header filled in by libwiretap,
    but instead construct our own pseudo-header, which is a bit cleaner.
    
    It also opens up the possibility of other dissectors passing radio
    information down to the 802.11 dissector, so it can display it in a
    better-organized format than the raw metadata headers for
    radiotap/PPI/Prism/AVS/etc., and having some of the options for 802.11
    dissection (Atheros padding, Centrino stuff, etc.) also passed in
    through that pseudo-header so we have fewer arguments to
    dissect_ieee80211_common().
