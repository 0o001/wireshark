    Remove the UTF-8 validation from proto_tree_add_string().
    
    proto_tree_add_item() does no validation if ENC_UTF_8 is used as the
    encoding, so there's no guarantee that the value of a string field is
    valid UTF-8, and in some dissectors UTF-8 strings are fetched with other
    mechanisms and then added with proto_tree_add_string().
    
    We need to do some cleanup on string handling.

    not harness the build-in codec framework. This results in empty Audio
    files for all but PCM encoded RTP streams. At least warn the user about
    the codec not being supported for saving in Audio file.

    Wiretap: Write commview files with valid headers
    
    When writing a capture as a commview file the header written is two
    bytes longer than the specification. Even though we count 24, we
    actually write 26. This makes the commview file corrupt, as is apparent
    when reading such file, eg., after using Save As... with this format.
    
    Replace writing 2 bytes for the last two fields in the header by 1 byte
    each, as per the header specification.

Date:   Mon Sep 2 16:09:24 2019 -0700

    What we're testing for is byte-swappedness, not raw endianness.
    
    On a big-endian machine, if the upper 16 bits of the length are non-zero
    and the lower 16 bits are zero, that means that the length is
    *little*-endian.
    
    What we really care about is whether the file is in the reading host's
    native format, so we can just fetch integral values without swapping, or
    not in that format, in which case we have to byte-swap integral values.
    
    Rename the variable and redo the code to match.
    
    (This may have caused the PacketLogger reader to fail on big-endian
    machines.)

    NFS: Fix hash table key memory corruption
    
    When the same (as determined by key_equal_func) key gets added to the
    GHashTable, old value gets freed and replaced with the new one. This is
    fine for hash tables where the key validity is not tightly coupled to
    the actual data.
    
    In the nfs_name_snoop_matched hash table the key becomes invalid once
    the value gets destroyed (because it shares the data pointed to by fh,
    which gets freed once the value is destroyed).
    
    A problematic capture includes packets such that the matching fh gets
    added twice to the nfs_name_snoop_matched hash table. Prior to this
    change the hash table would end up in a state where the new value is
    associated with the old key (which contains pointer to already freed
    memory). According to the nfs_name_snoop_matched_equal(), the old key
    was equal to the key intended for new value *at the time* of insertion.
    
    This change fixes the bug by using g_hash_table_replace() which does
    update the key in case it already exists in the GHashTable.

    Wiretap: Fix temporary filename memory corruption
    
    The pointer returned by create_tempfile() must not be freed. As the
    wtap_dump_open_tempfile() callers are freeing the returned filename,
    duplicate the string so it can be freed.

    EAP: force a new conversation at EAP-Request/Identify
    
    TLS requires unique conversations for every TLS session. With EAP-TTLS
    over EAPOL, only a single conversation was created, breaking TLS.
    Force a new conversation at the start of the EAP protocol to fix this.
    
    This alone was not sufficient, the right conversation was not always
    matched. This happened due to wildcard matching in EAP (NO_PORT_B) while
    TLS does not use NO_PORT_B. TLS ended up setting a dummy port via
    "conversation_set_port2" because PT_NONE is considered connection-less.
    Even after treating PT_NONE as *not* connection-less in conversation.c,
    the EAP Success message was not correctly matched against a conversation
    and resulted into creation of another conversation.
    
    To avoid all of that mess, just use the same conversation matching logic
    as TLS, without NO_PORT_B. The original conversation tracking logic in
    EAP was presumably added to avoid multiple conversations for EAP over
    RADIUS (UDP), but that requirement does not seem necessary.
    
    Verified with `tshark -2r eap-tls-bug-cert.pcap -otls.log_file:out.txt`,
    two different `conversation =` values exist for the two sessions.

    - fontMetrics().width(text) -> fontMetrics.boundingRect(text).width():
      the bounding box width could be larger than horizontalAdvance(text).
      For the bytes view, they should be the same due to monospace font.
      The display filter field calculation was made more accurate (it
      assumes that textMargins() is 0 which is the default).
