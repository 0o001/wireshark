    SNMP: handle Net-SNMP Engine Id of 12 octets
    
    The Net-SNMP code creates an Engine Id size based on the compilation
    size, either 8 or 12 octets long. The initial change added handling of
    the '4B/8B random, 4B epoch seconds' format. A different format seems
    more likely though, hence this change, implementing handling of the
    '4B random, 4B/8B epoch seconds' format instead.

    Using the default RFC4122 decoder assumes big endian and results in displaying

    Increase maximum USBPcap packet size to 128 MiB
    
    It turned out that 1 MiB is not enough as atleast the URBs sent by
    Android fastbool tools are greater than 1 MiB (1 MiB payload + USBPcap
    pseudoheader). Raise the maximum packet size all the way up to 128 MiB.
    128 MiB is the upper bound of maximum packet that can be captured by
    all official USBPcap releases.

    IP: Make dissection of ip.frag_offset RFC 791 compliant
    
    The v2.5.0rc0-478-g558fe23226, the dissection of ip.frag_offset changed
    to be listed under "Flags", this is not correct. The Fragmentation
    Offset is a separate field according to the RFC. This change corrects
    that behavior. Also, the raw value from the header was shown instead of
    the real byte offset, this is also corrected.

    travis: improve cache handling on Windows
    
    The Travis casher Bash implementation for Windows has bugs. The
    workarounds only slow down the build further. Given the lack of feedback
    on the casher bugs from Travis CI, let's try to improve it. Hopefully
    this will avoid stalls during the cache step.
    
    The "cd .." and "cd build" hack is required due to an annoying bug:

    test: add support for pytest 5.2.0
    
    pytest 5.2.0 added support for callable scopes. In order to distinguish
    those (`@pytest.fixture(scope=fn)`) from decorators (`@pytest.fixture`),
    it added extra arguments which was not expected by our wrapper. See
    https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/5776 for the change.
    
    Fixes the following error:
    
        ImportError while loading conftest 'test/conftest.py'.

    We do not use non-keyword arguments, so it is safe to use `*` instead of
    `*args` in the prototype.

    Fix checks for "do we have an ERSPAN header?"
    
    For a GRE protocol type of 0x008E, check the "sequence number present"
    bit in the GRE header, if it's available, to see if the packet has an
    ERSPAN header or not, rather than checking the entire header to see if
    it's zero.  (If the GRE header isn't available, assume no ERSPAN
    header.)
    
    For a GRE protocol type of 0x22EB, always treat the packet as having an
    ERSPAN header.
    
    That matches more closely what the most recent I-D for ERSPAN said.

    Win32: Do not reload TLS keylog file on each packet
    
    On Windows, fstat() and stat() sets st_dev to different value depending
    on whether it was called with file handle or file path. If file handle
    was used, the st_dev is simply the file handle casted to unsigned.
    If file path was used, then st_dev corresponds to drive letter
    (A=0, B=1, C=2, ...).
    
    Compare the files using the file index information retrieved by
    GetFileInformationByHandle(). When compiled in configuration that
    supports FILE_ID_INFO, the code first tries to obtain 128-bit FILE_ID_INFO
    and if that fails, fallback to GetFileInformationByHandle().
