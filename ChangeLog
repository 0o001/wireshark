    Handle -k better on platforms that don't support it.
    
    Have ws80211_init() return an indication that channel setting isn't
    supported on those platforms.
    
    In dumpcap, try to set up ws80211 before checking the channel argument
    and, if it fails, report the failure, rather than failing because the
    "convert channel name to channel code" routine fails.
    
    See
    
        https://ask.wireshark.org/question/15535/dumpcap-k-is-not-accepting-channel-type-values/

    Maintain cf->state, because file cleanup depends on it.
    
    If we're capturing to multiple files, whenever we are told about a new
    file, we must close the old file, so we don't leak file descriptors and
    wtap structures.
    
    Have cf_close() handle the work of closing, the way it does in file.c,
    and, when we *open* a file, set the state in capture_file to
    FILE_READ_IN_PROGRESS.

    RTCP: contain BYE packet dissection to its stated length
    
    The Goodbye RTCP packet dissection has to derive whether the optional
    "Reason for leaving" string is present or not. This has to be derived
    from the length. When put into a compound RTCP packet, the length
    derivation from the TVB length does not work, because another RTCP
    packet may follow in this compound RTCP packet.
    
    With this change the stated length of this RTCP packet is passed to
    the RTCP BYE packet dissection function in order to make a proper
    length determination and not overrun into the next RTCP packet in the
    compound RTCP packet.

    tvb_bytes_to_str expects a non-NULL tvb, explicitly check for this and
    add a dummy placeholder. This is intended to be a human-readable string,

    These are normally just false positive warnings in old compilers, fixed
    in newer GCC. It fails only because it was built from git master as
    opposed to a release branch where -Werror is disabled by default.
    
    Save some resources, and remove GCC 5. The CentOS-7 job still tests the
    old GCC 4.8.5 compiler. Newer GCC versions are handled by other jobs.

Author: Mark Vitale <mvitale@sinenomine.net>
Date:   Wed Dec 18 16:31:23 2019 -0500

    afs: correctly calulate padding for strings
    
    length+value strings in AFS are padded to a multiple of 4 octets.
    A bug caused the dissector to add an extra 4-octet pad when no padding
    was required.  This causes any field after the string to be
    mis-dissected, resulting in a false alarm "Malformed packet".
    
    Correct the padding logic to eliminate the false alarm.

    gitlab-ci: remove unnecessary jobs, upgrade versions
    
    The point of testing multiple compiler versions is to catch bugs that
    only occur in one particular version. After an analysis of 800+ failed
    builds, it appears that a lot of the checks are redundant. Changes:
    
    * Drop GCC 6 and keep GCC 5, Ubuntu 16.04 default GCC is 5.3. Fixes for
      warnings in old compilers: commit 829d2c3752 (GCC 5 + 6), commit
      e451ea0a4d (Clang 5, GCC 4 + 5). Maybe GCC 5 can also be dropped since
      Ubuntu 18.04 is around for a while.
    * Drop clang-nopcap, all errors caught by Clang were also caught by GCC.
      One change caught by gcc-8-nopcap but not Clang: commit 036c3d6bc7.
    * Remove Clang 5: even though it triggers some unique failures, no major
      distro ships with it so remove it.
    * Drop old Clang versions, newer versions catch all warnings from older.
    * Upgrade to Clang 8 which is already installed in the Docker image.
    * Remove EOL Fedora 28 and 29, use latest (31).
    * Remove EOL openSUSE Leap 42.3, keep 15.1 as the latest.
    
    Reduces from 20 jobs (15 build, 5 test) to 10 jobs (7 build, 3 test).
