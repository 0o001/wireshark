    BACapp: Add a nesting / recursion check.
    
    Track our recursion depth in fAbstractSyntaxNType. It calls several
    functions which in turn call it, which makes it easy to overflow the
    stack.

    Handle -k better on platforms that don't support it.
    
    Have ws80211_init() return an indication that channel setting isn't
    supported on those platforms.
    
    In dumpcap, try to set up ws80211 before checking the channel argument
    and, if it fails, report the failure, rather than failing because the
    "convert channel name to channel code" routine fails.
    
    See
    
        https://ask.wireshark.org/question/15535/dumpcap-k-is-not-accepting-channel-type-values/
    
    for an example of confusion caused by the previous behavior.

    RTCP: contain BYE packet dissection to its stated length
    
    The Goodbye RTCP packet dissection has to derive whether the optional
    "Reason for leaving" string is present or not. This has to be derived
    from the length. When put into a compound RTCP packet, the length
    derivation from the TVB length does not work, because another RTCP
    packet may follow in this compound RTCP packet.
    
    With this change the stated length of this RTCP packet is passed to
    the RTCP BYE packet dissection function in order to make a proper
    length determination and not overrun into the next RTCP packet in the
    compound RTCP packet.

    afs: correctly calulate padding for strings
    
    length+value strings in AFS are padded to a multiple of 4 octets.
    A bug caused the dissector to add an extra 4-octet pad when no padding
    was required.  This causes any field after the string to be
    mis-dissected, resulting in a false alarm "Malformed packet".
    
    Correct the padding logic to eliminate the false alarm.
