    epan: Use hash table for dependent frames

    Dependent frames list order does not matter and thus significantly

    epan: Do not add dependent packets more than once

    Do not add a dependent frame if it's already been added to a
    frame's list. Do not mark a frame as a dependent of a displayed
    frame if we've already marked it as such in this pass.

    Clear the list of dependent frames if we reset the frame data,
    because the list of dependent frames depends on the dissection
    and may not be valid if redissecting (because, for example,
    a reassembly preference may have changed.)

    Move the pointer to the list of dependent frames away from the
    bitfields to a location that minimizes the struct size.

    SIP: Ignore probable keep alives

    If we have payload on TCP with a single octet that is not printable ASCII,
    just reject it rather than waiting for the next CRLF line end (and
    marking it as Continuation Data then). It is more likely to be a TCP Keep
    Alive at the beginning of a capture file or connection.

    At best, this change means that a correct SIP request or response is
    interpreted rather than marking as Continuation Data. At worst,
    Continuation Data has one less non printable octet at the beginning.

    Fix #18411.

    tcp: Fix handling of retransmission for reassembly

    When reassemble_ooo is set, we can do a better job determining
    if a segment is retransmitted or not from the reassembler perspective,
    which is different than what TCP sequence analysis determines, which
    is retransmission from the sender's perspective.

    This also allows us to have a good way of dealing with retransmission
    but with additional data.

    This only works when reassembling out of order is set. Without it,
    we fall back to the old method of detecting retransmissions, which
    has a harder time with the edge cases.

    Fix #17406, fix #15993, fix #13388, fix #13523.

    Qt: Fix click to packet on OverlayScrollBar

    Fix the calculation of the ratio for converting a packet number
    to the scrollbar value by accounting for the length of the slider.
    maximum() does not correpond to the last packet; it corresponds to
    the first packet shown when the scrollbar is at maximum. The last
    packet is maximum() + pageStep().
    (See https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qscrollbar.html#details)

    The quarter of a page padding should be subtracted, not added,
    from the calculated position.
    (Fix up 422c0f45d497872a963363132ec92d400a79538f)

    This correctly makes clicking on the a line in the minimap scroll
    the packet list so that the corresponding packet is 25% of the
    way down the visible window. (Excepting the cases of packets at
    the very beginning or end of the entire packet list.)

    XML: Do escape ASCII control characters

    XML 1.0 allows valid UTF-8 characters, except for the ASCII control
    characters other than tab, carriage return, and line feed.
    (It does not allow form feed and vertical tab, so the allowed group is
    not the same as the standard ctype.h isspace category. It also
    allows but discourages DEL (\x7F).)

    The characters cannot be included as character references of the
    form &#xx; either; there is technically no way to include them.
    Escape them as done prior to 89e96c1e77a39a259cafb488c6057e6c123d692b
    but continue to leave bytes with the high bit set alone so that
    UTF-8 printable characters are not escaped.

    RTP Stream Dialog: Actually sort on packet loss

    The packet loss column has been sorting on a private variable
    that is never set(?!) and also is unsigned whereas the actual

    and sort by that. (Should this be sorting by the total number or
    the percentage, since the column displays both? Total number is

    Qt: Fix order of ShowAs enums

    wiretap: treat file extensions case-insensitively

    Modify `get_file_extension()` to convert the filename to all lower-case,
    so the file extension(s) are returned as such. This effectively makes
    `heuristic_uses_extension()` operate case-insensitively, since it's
    comparing against the extensions in `open_routines[]` which are also
    stored in lower-case.

    tests: Get tests working with Python 3.11 (except with pytest)

    We use a common idiom ( https://stackoverflow.com/a/39606065
    https://gist.github.com/hynekcer/1b0a260ef72dae05fe9611904d7b9675 )
    for getting the results of our unittest.TestCases in the tearDown
    method. This method accesses a private property, and that private
    property was removed in Python 3.11

    The StackOverflow answer has been updated with a new approach for
    Python 3.11, which also uses a private property. This fixes things
    for CTest (and the test target when building), but it still doesn't
    work when using pytest's unittest support.

    Qt: Clear selection, not current, in drawCurrentPacket

    QItemSelectionModel tracks both the selected index and the
    current index.

    PacketList redraws when the *selected* index changes, not
    the current index. Clearing the current index, and then marking
    the same packet as selected and current fires currentChanged but
    not selectionChanged. So drawCurrentPacket needs to call
    clearSelection(), not clearCurrentIndex(), in order to trigger
    a redissection of the currently selected packet and update
    the packet details.

    For example, if you mark or unmark the currently selected frame,
    this causes the packet details to update. Cf 52955b9c43a99942b3,
    which fixed the same issue but for Find Packet.

    Fix #14330.
