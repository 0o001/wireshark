    addr_resolv: fix external reverse IPv6 lookup in tshark

    Pass a pointer to the IPv6 address instead of a pointer to the pointer.

    Fixes #19294

    iscsi: Check bounds when extracting TargetAddress

    Use tvb_ functions that do bounds checking when parsing the
    TargetAddress string, instead of incrementing a pointer to an
    extracted char* and sometimes accidentally overrunning the
    string.

    While we're there, go ahead and add support for IPv6 addresses.

    Fix #19164

    Qt: Don't use winId() on a child widget (Qt Wayland issue)

    On Qt Wayland, winId() should only be used on a top-level window:
    https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-76983
    https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-93103
    https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=424024
    https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-75766

    Using it on the child widget and getting a native window causes the
    packet list to fail to redraw correctly when scrolling. (It does
    redraw when the window is brought to the back and then back to the front.)

    NAS 5GS: Don't double advance the offset

    the return value, don't advance the offset separately.

Author: John Thacker <johnthacker@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Aug 10 05:29:09 2023 -0400

    btsdp: Keep offset advancing

    hf_data_element_value is a FT_NONE, so we can add the item with
    the expected length and get_hfi_length() will adjust the length
    without throwing an exception. There's no need to add it with
    zero length and call proto_item_set_len. Also, don't increment
    the offset by 0 instead of the real length when there isn't
    enough data in the packet, as that can lead to failing to advance
    the offset.

    When dissecting a sequence type (sequence or alternative) and
    recursing into the sequence member, instead of using the main
    packet tvb directly, create a subset using the indicated length
    of the sequence. That will properly throw an exception if a
    contained item is larger than the containing sequence, instead of
    dissecting the same bytes as several different items (inside
    the sequence recursively, as well in the outer loop.)

    wmem: Fix leak in block_fast when realloc'ing jumbo blocks

    In block fast wmem_allocator is used, keep the double linked
    list of jumbo blocks accurate by pointing the prev pointer of
    the old head (if it exists) to the newly allocated jumbo block.

    This prevents a leak if a jumbo block which is not the most
    recently added jumbo block is realloc'ed. If the prev pointer
    isn't set properly, then all the jumbo blocks added afterwards
    will be lost from the list and leaked.

    GUI: Colorize with filter could use an old filter

    When right-clicking an item in the packet details and using "Colorize
    with Filter", the colour may be applied using the wrong filter.

    The code currently only updates the filter used for "Colorize with
    Filter" if the packet details are visible and has focus. This is not
    the case when you switch from one packet to another (at least by
    clicking the other frame in the packet list).

    The patch moves the emit of fieldFilterChanged() up to where the
    filed_filter is identified. This seems the least intrusive.

    GSM A DTAP: fix value-string for Signalling Access Protocol

    Last time this value-string was edited in 959a2909612, and before
    this commit there was only one value (all other values resevred):

      case 0x01: str = "According to ITU-T Rec. Q.920 and ITU-T Rec. Q.930";
      case 0x02: str = "Reserved: was allocated in earlier phases of the protocol";
      case 0x03: str = "Reserved: was allocated in earlier phases of the protocol";
      case 0x04: str = "Reserved: was allocated in earlier phases of the protocol";
      case 0x05: str = "Reserved: was allocated in earlier phases of the protocol";
      case 0x06: str = "Reserved: was allocated in earlier phases of the protocol";
      default:   str = "Reserved";

    This matches the definition of the "Signalling access protocol (octet 5)"
    in recent version (17.8.0, 2022-10) of 3GPP TS 24.008.  However, the
    above-mentioned commit replaced the switch statement with a value-string
    conforming neither 3GPP TS 24.008, nor the earlier GSM 04.08.

    Let's revert back to the correct description, and additionally take
    a chance to specify the old meaning of reserved values (from GSM 04.08).

    TLS: use macros for GREASE checks

    The tests in `packet-tls-utils.c` for GREASE values aren't strictly
    correct, in that they would falsely ignore a value such as 0x1a2a.

    Create a macro to replace this test, which also serves to document the
    intent of the test to future developers.

    Also create a macro for the reserved values of QUIC transport parameters
    which serve a similar function as GREASE.
