    ws_pipe: fix memory leaks in spawn arguments handling
    
    On Windows, ws_pipe_spawn_sync always leaks 'winargs', and leaks 'argv'
    on some error paths. Fix these and refactor the common argument parsing
    functionality to reduce duplication of functionality.

Date:   Tue Apr 30 15:52:38 2019 +0200

    wsutil: Fix 30 seconds freeze if process fails to start
    
    In ws_pipe_wait_for_pipe() on Windows, the WaitForMultipleObjects() waits
    on the pending pipe connection events and process handle. If the process
    handle is signalled, then it means that the process did exit without
    connecting to the pipes.
    
    The WaitForMultipleObjects() was not waiting on the process handle and thus
    if the process did fail without connecting to pipes the Wireshark gui was
    frozen for 30 seconds.
    
    This change fixes the freeze by increasing the number of handles, so
    WaitForMultipleObjects() is aware of the process handle.

    Qt: prevent inline completion from happening for filters
    
    Commit v3.1.0rc0-1170-ga854811c4a replaced the deprecated
    `setAutoCompletion(false)` call by `setCompleter(0)`. However, the
    former has as side-effect that it prevents setLineEdit from creating a
    custom completer. setCompleter on the other hand had no effect since
    there was no existing completer.
    
    To fix the issue, remove the completer after it is set by setLineEdit.
    This has no effect on the completer from CaptureFilterEdit and
    DisplayFilterEdit instances since they override the completer from
    QLineEdit. To avoid any confusion, SyntaxLineEdit::setCompleter (and
    completer) should probably be renamed, these are not used by QComboBox
    since it is not marked as virtual method.

    Don't report EPIPE errors writing out packet information.
    
    EPIPE almost certainly means "the next program after us in the pipeline
    exited before we were finished writing", so this isn't a real error, it
    just means we're done.  (We don't get SIGPIPE because libwireshark
    ignores SIGPIPE to avoid getting killed if writing to the MaxMind
    process gets SIGPIPE because that process died.)
    
    Presumably either that program exited deliberately (for example, "head
    -N" read N lines and printed them), in which case there's no error to
    report, or it terminated due to an error or a signal, in which case
    *that's* the error and that error has been reported.
    
    (We don't do that for EINVAL, as that's presumably a real error.  It
    shows up on Windows in bug 16192, but what we probably want to do there
    is to, on Windows, use _doserrno, check for the equivalent Windows
    errors, and, for the default case, convert _doserrno to the appropriate
    string, using Windows APIs, and report *that* string; the MS C library
    converts a whole bunch of Windows errors to EINVAL, thus losing
    information and making it harder to determine what the real error is.
    
    Therefore, I'm just marking this with Ping-Bug, as it's only fixing the
    problem on UN*Xes.)

    Qt: Keep extcap control channels when capturing to multiple files
    
    When using the "Create a new file automatically" feature the capture in
    Wireshark will stop and start, but the extcap utility will continue run
    as normal. Ensure the control channels are kept when doing this.
    
    Rename the unused capture_session.session_started to session_will_restart
    to detect this.

    RTP: rtp_audio_stream.cpp: fixed excess silence in visualisation on waveform
    
    When silence is inserted to waveform (VaD, no RTP, ...), waveform is shifted to correct time in visualisation. Code was inserting silence to audio waveform too therefore following audio was shifted twice.
    This patch fixes it.

    When the stream contains a mix of G.711A/U and silence, the RTP Analysis dialog
     prevented it from being saved. Add an exception for silence to fix this.
