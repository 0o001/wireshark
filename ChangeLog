    Add a timeline view for packets, with the timing data used to generate the display
    taken from the timing analysis done in the wlan_radio dissector. QT only.
    
    The timeline background is light gray, white for packets displayed in the packetlist,
    and blue for the currently selected packet. Packets are coloured according to the
    colouring rules foreground colour. The timeline can be zoomed with controls on the
    toolbar.
    
    At higher zoom levels the duration (NAV) field is plotted as a horizontal line to the
    right of a packet.
    
    The height of a packet in the timeline is proportional to the RSSI.
    
    The bottom half of the packet is only shown if it matches the display filter.
    
    Todo:
    Auto detect TSF timing reference point (start/end of packet)
    Add a scrollbar
    Add a ruler showing time
    Improve handling of focus.
    Do not display NAV for packets with bad FCS.
    Show related packets graphically
    Different Y axis modes
    - bandwidth/channel use display
    - different transmitters per line
    - background color from coloring rules

    Allow bigger snapshot lengths for D-Bus captures.
    
    Use WTAP_MAX_PACKET_SIZE_STANDARD, set to 256KB, for everything except
    for D-Bus captures.  Use WTAP_MAX_PACKET_SIZE_DBUS, set to 128MB, for
    them, because that's the largest possible D-Bus message size.  See
    
            https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100220
    
    for an example of the problems caused by limiting the snapshot length to
    256KB for D-Bus.
    
    Have a snapshot length of 0 in a capture_file structure mean "there is
    no snapshot length for the file"; we don't need the has_snap field in
    that case, a value of 0 mean "no, we don't have a snapshot length".
    
    In dumpcap, start out with a pipe buffer size of 2KB, and grow it as
    necessary.  When checking for a too-big packet from a pipe, check
    against the appropriate maximum - 128MB for DLT_DBUS, 256KB for
    everything else.

    Bring some modernity to this dissector and use tcp_dissect_pdus.  Also an excuse to
    remove the conversation_set_dissector in the heuristic dissector which was generating
    some false positives because the heuristic isn't that strong.

commit 0ec22de
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Jun 4 12:15:34 2017 -0700

    Allocate the pipe capture data buffer upfront.
    
    We were allocating it every time we called cap_pipe_dispatch() (or,
    prior to I0256daae8478f1100fdde96a16a404465ec200b3, in
    capture_loop_dispatch()) and freeing it before the routine in question
    returned.
    
    However, we were treating that buffer as if it persisted from call to
    call, which worked *only* if freeing and re-allocating the buffer meant
    that we'd get back the same buffer with its previous contents intact.
    
    That is *not* guaranteed to work.
    
    Instead, allocate the buffer when we open the capture pipe, and free it
    when we close the capture pipe.

    Allocate a buffer in cap_pipe_dispatch(), not in capture_loop_dispatch().
    
    The buffer is only used when reading from a pipe; no need to allocate it
    when capturing from a pcap_t.
    
    Doing it in cap_pipe_dispatch() makes it clearer when the buffer exists
    and when it doesn't.

    Don't keep the pcap/pcapng link-layer header type as interface data.
    
    Either 1) it can be determined from the libwiretap encapsulation type,
    in which case it's redundant information or 2) there *is* no pcap/pcapng
    link-layer header type for that encapsulation type, in which case you
    need to check for the attempt to determine it failing and handle that
    failure appropriately.

    If has_snaplen isn't set, don't set the snapshot length with pcap_create()/pcap_activate().
    
    Just let libpcap pick the snapshot length; that way, for link-layer
    types that need a really large snapshot length, such as D-Bus (which
    requires 128MB for the largest messages), it can pick that, but can
    otherwise pick something that doesn't require as much memory, e.g.
    256KB.
    
    For pcap_open_live() and pcap_open(), which don't have a way of saying
    "give me what's appropriate", pick 256KB.

    it rather than memset().
    
    Whether removing initializer warnings is a Good Thing is subject to
    debate; remove a comment that implies it's been deemed a Good Thing.

    packet-epl.c: Fixup missing initializer warnings
    
    macOS Buildbot doesn't like {0} (probably because GNU C already provides {}
    exactly for the purpose of initializing all members to zero/NULL/0.0.. etc)
    
    Affected local type definitions now have a static intializer macro that uses
    the correct amount of zeroes and braces (similar to PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER)
    Global type definitions have a memset to zero (Which isn't strictly correct,
    but as the platforms we support all have all-bits-zero-nulls and IEEE 754
    floats, it should be good enough. A separate change will attempt to disable
    -Wmissing-field-initializers -Wmissing-braces globally and hopefully make
    these workarounds unnecessary.

    packet-epl.c: Enhance dissection by ObjectMappings and device profiles
    
    Cyclic PDOs are setup either by ObjectMappings in the asynchronous SDOs,
    or by serialized ObjectMappings in device profile files.
    
    We now keep track of ObjectMappings transmitted via SDOs or read from
    XDC files and use those to correctly partition the PDO's payloads.
    
    Additionally types and descriptions for Object Directory entries extracted
    from the EDS and XDD profiles are used to select the correct Wireshark type
    and a string representation for those partitoned PDOs. Other places where
    indices and subindices are also enriched by this information.
    
    EDS support leverages GKeyFile and is available unconditionally, XDD/XDC
    parsing support depends on the availabilty of libxml2. A patch for
    inclusion of the latter as optional dependency was submitted
    as Change-Id: I13c0a2f408fb5c21bad7ab3d7971e0fa8ed7d783
    
    Electronic Data Sheet (EDS) is the CANopen standard for device profiles,
    POWERLINK being based on CANopen, is occasionly used with EDS profiles.
    
    XML Device Description (XDD) is the Ethernet POWERLINK standard for
    device profiles. XDC have the same structure but contain actualValues
    fields which can contain default ObjectMappings.
    
    XML Device Descriptions can be 25k+ lines with much duplication,
    so wmem_iarray_t is leveraged for saving space as well as faster lookups.
    
    A side-effect of now organizing the capture in conversations is that
    POWERLINK over UDP packets are now assigned proper destination and source
    node IDs, which are displayed in the column view. The Referenced bug where
    packets where erronously flagged as duplicates because the address wasn't
    considered is also fixed as a result.

    Add interval array data structure, with growable intervals
    
    A sorted array keyed by intervals
    You keep inserting items, then sort the array.
    sorting also compacts items that compare equal into one and adjusts
    the interval accordingly. find uses binary search to find the item
    
    This is particularly useful, if you got many similar items,
    e.g. ObjectMapping subindices in the XDD. XDDs can be upward of
    25k lines long with much duplication (253 subindices having the same
    content).
    
    Interval Trees wouldn't work, because they didn't allow expanding
    existing intervals. Using an array instead of a tree, additionally offers
    a possible performance advantage, but it's not that critical here,
    as finding should only happen in the async frames
    
    There's room for optimization in the creation process of the array,
    but it doesn't matter much, as they aren't created frequently.
    Finding speed is what matters for the use case of parsing EDS
    and XDD files

Author: Jeff Morriss <jeff.morriss.ws@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 6 21:49:50 2017 -0500

    Fix up dissector tables' UI names.
    
    This was inspired by using the Decode-As UI to decode Field "SSL TCP Dissector"
    Value (port) XXX as YYY.  "SSL Port" makes more sense as the UI name.

    Fixup support of BASE_UNIT_STRING for 64 bit based integer fields
    
    proto.c’s proto_custom_set() was missing a test for
    BASE_UNIT_STRING under the 64 bit based integer case.  Any
    custom columns sourced from a field stored in a 64 bit integer
    and having the BASE_UNIT_STRING attribute would only display the
    units but not the actual number.
    
    With this patch 64 bit based integer fields having the
    BASE_UNIT_STRING attribute will now properly display both
    their value and units when added to the packet list as a
    custom column.

    LAPDm: Support the LAPDm B4 Frame Format
    
    The B4 Frame Format is used on the downlink SACCH and has no length
    field.
    
    While the comment on top of packet-lapdm.c claimed ever since its
    introduction in 2009 that B4 was a supported format, in fact it was not
    supported yet.  This patch makes handling the length field conditional
    to a frame format that has a length field, and introduces lapdm_data_t
    that can be passed using call_dissector_with_data().
    
    The GSMTAP dissector is updated to use this mechanism to specify the
    frame format based on the channel type.

Date:   Tue May 23 18:58:36 2017 +0200

    SMB2: set session server port in partial capture
    
    When dissecting a capture that does not have a session setup exchange,
    assume tree connect response packets are coming from the server and set
    the port accordingly.
    
    This is needed for decryption because the decryption key is different
    depending on which side the message was created on. We need to set the
    server port to know if a packet was made on the server.

    UMTS FP: Track Paging Indications in PCH
    
    The dissector now carries the 'Paging Indication Bitmap' between subsequent PCH frames.
    The reason for this is any frame containing the bitmap 'wakes up' users to read the subsequence frame. This feature allows us to see which paging groups were called for each frame.
    Also refactored some Paging Indication related fields in the umts convoersation object and tree items.

commit 6b289a8
Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Sat May 13 19:21:45 2017 +0200

    ssl,dtls: fix message hash for extended_master_secret
    
    The handshake_messages for extended master secret start at Client Hello
    and end at ClientKeyExchange. Previously all handshake messages in a
    record would be hashed, possibly covering those after CKE. Now it will
    hash each handshake message separately.
    
    For DTLS, the CH and HVR messages must also be ignored. Additionally,
    DTLS needs special treatment to merge multiple fragments.

    OPC UA: Added details for BrowseDescription NodeClassMask and ResultMask
    
    Display the details for the NodeClassMask and ResultMask values in a
    BrowseRequest's BrowseDescription.
    As described in OPC UA 1.03 Specification, the value 0 for the
    NodeClassMask and the value 63 (0x003F) for ResultMask should results in
    returning all the fields in the BrowseResponse.
    Display 'All' when those fields have those values
    Display a detailled bit tree mask when values are different
    
    Code Change:

    Force HAVE_REMOTE to be defined when including pcap.h with remote support.
    
    WinPcap made the mistake of having stuff in its public header fines
    depend on a configuration #define, HAVE_REMOTE; this means that we need
    to forcibly define it when building with remote capture support.
    
    The tip of the libpcap master branch does not have that botch; hopefully
    future versions of libpcap-for-Windows will be based on that libpcap and
    thus lack that botch as well.
    
    Defining HAVE_REMOTE in config.h is not the right fix, as it makes it
    look like a *Wireshark* configuration option that code in Wireshark
    should test, rather than a *WinPcap* configuration option that the
    pcap.h that ships with the WinPcap SDK should have been changed, as part
    of the build process, to correctly define or not, so that users of
    WinPcap don't have to define it themselves.

    After a M_NEXT_EXIST(), you should always have another variable (like

    CSN_DESCR_END.
    Note that this is a workaround as the current description does not allow

    While we're at it, note that "PCAP" in "HAVE_PCAP_REMOTE" can refer to
    libpcap as well as WinPcap, given that, at least in the tip of the
    master branch, you can configure remote support in libpcap, although
    it's not enabled by default (it needs to be vetted for security, as it
    increases the attack surface of a machine running the server *and* of an

commit b8040a4
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue May 9 14:28:57 2017 -0700

    Fix various field names and types.
    
    Make some names used for multiple fields more stylistically consistent.
    
    If a bitfield has more than one bit, it's not Boolean - the extra bits
    mean it has more values than "true" or "false".
    
    If a bitfield has only one bit, and indicates that something is
    true/false, or enabled/disabled, or present/absent, or on/off, or
    something else obviously Boolean, it's Boolean.

    Set nss and rate_mcs_index in more arms of the Series II PLCP switch.
    
    For HT mixed, set it the same way it's set for HT greenfield.
    
    For pre-HT, set it to 0.
    
    Also, for the "unknown" case, set rate_mcs_index to 0.
    This should obviate the need to initialize either of those variables,
    don't initialize them, so that failing to set them in an arm of the
    switch statement shows up as an error if the compiler's dataflow
    analysis actually bothers to check this.

    Qt: try harder to find a working monospace font
    
    QFont::toString returned the default font (which might be unavailable),
    leading to use of non-monospace fonts in the bytes view. Detect the
    effective font instead and apply it to avoid this issue.
    
    Add additional logic to invoke font detection when the configured font
    is bad (for example, because of the bug or because a font has been
    removed in meantime).

    Fixed the column info when displaying VP8 sub protocol to RTP.
    
    The RTP header information was no longer displayed, and this is very useful
    information. It certainly looked like the VP8 information was supposed to
    be extra to the existing info (the dash in the text), and should have been
    tacked on the end.

    That should remove the need to initialize them, make it clearer what

    they don't get set in the "not just RF" case in the future.

    which can be accessed on:
    autosar.org -> Classic Platform -> Software Arch -> Comm Stack.
    
    It can run over UDP or CAN, which is why "UDP" is not in any user

    This function returns TRUE/FALSE depending whether the specified ProtoField/Dissector

    attribute, Lua dissectors can be significantly sped up by making less C interop calls
    which are relatively slow in terms of dissection especially when using sub-protocols
    where the dissection of an entire protocol can be skipped.
    
    Added tests for TreeItem:referenced to protofield.lua

    nsh: fix stack overflow due to missing length checks
    
    After v2.3.0rc0-3167-ge6f944d632, the NSH dissector could call itself
    recursively and since the minimum header length was not validated, it
    could result in a stack overflow due to infinite recursion.
    
    Add checks based on the text from
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sfc-nsh-12#section-3.2
    
    This patch also fixes a regression since v2.3.0rc0-3171-g2273cf0e7b
    where the wrong tvb was passed to subdissectors. Tested with the two
    captures from bug 11490.

    Auto reset epan session
    
    
    Automatically resets intarnal epan session after reaching to

    will reset the session every 1000 packets.
    
    this is more like a proposal since the usage is very specific

    Qt: Inhibit Disable Protocol when applicable
    
    The packet details context menu allows you, through the Protocol
    Preferences sub menu to manipulate (disable) the protocol dissection
    through the Disable <protocol>... option. This opens up the appropriate
    dialog and select the applicable protocol.
    This fails for protocols which have their can_toggle flag reset (e.g.
    the frame protocol). The dialog opens, but the protocol can't be found,
    hence the top item is selected.
    
    Instead disable the menu option for protocols which can't have their
    enabled state toggled.

    dfilter: fix memleak when using value_string values
    
    When using a filter such as "ncp.alloc_reply_lvl2 == FALSE", a memory
    leak would occur as follows:
    
     1. dfilter_fvalue_from_unparsed is called and
     2. ends up calling _uint64_from_unparsed
     3. which fails with error message "\"FALSE\" is not a valid number.".
     4. Next, mk_fvalue_from_val_string is called which maps "FALSE" to 0
     5. and the filter is successfully compiled.
     6. dfwork_free deliberately does not free the error message (since
        there should be none at this point) and we have a memleak (from 3).
    
    Fix this memleak by clearing the error message when a successful
    value_string mapping is found.

commit c6b56bb
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Wed May 3 00:23:33 2017 -0700

    Fix handling of Header IEs.
    
    Add the tree for the type/length/element ID for *all* IEs, whether we
    know the IE type or not.
    
    The total length of the IE is 2 + the value of the length field; always
    advance by that much.  This prevents infinite loops.
    
    Fix the name of a field.

    Pass inforation from dissect_ixveriwave() to wlantap_dissect().
    
    Always set log_mode - if the command type is 3, set log_mode to 0, as
    it's not supplied by the libwiretap code.
    
    Pass log_mode and is_octo from dissect_ixveriwave() to
    wlantap_dissect().  Test is_octo in wlantap_dissect(), just as we do in
    dissect_ixveriwave().

    Remove runlex.sh script, just run lex directly
    
    This removes the need for sh (and Cygwin) on Windows to build Wireshark.
    
    runlex.sh (added in commits 5be4499a and 517d6d57) was added because
    older flex had quirks with its options (and the --header(-file) option
    was not available). The minimum required flex version for reentrant
    scanners (2.5.6) does not have these issues though, so remove the step.

    cmake: fix build without libxml2
    
    When LibXml2 is not found, the LIBXML2_LIBRARIES is set to
    "LIBXML2_LIBRARIES-NOTFOUND" rather than an empty string (as other
    FindXxx modules do). This results in an error because the variable is
    used in target_link_libraries (via epan_LIBS).
    
    As workaround, explicitly clear the variable to ignore the cache entry.

    slsk: fix infinite loop
    
    If check_slsk_format reports that the buffer does not contain the
    expected data, do not try to find more items (break out of the loop).
    
    In one case, an infinite loop would occur because the index variable was
    not incremented when the check fails. In all other cases, it would
    perform up to 2^32 calls to check_slsk_format per loop (with the same
    offset parameter, so no exception is triggered).

commit a4eb68b
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sat Apr 22 22:22:00 2017 -0700

    Rename some routines to better reflect what they do.
    
    In TShark, rename load_cap_file() to read_cap_file(); this is TShark,
    not Wireshark, so you're not "loading" a file to be manipulated through
    the GUI.
    
    In TFShark, rename it to "read_file()"; not only are we not loading it,
    it's not even necessarily a capture file.

    Take the error message generation out of the merge_files routines.
    
    Have them just return the information needed for the caller to produce
    an error message, and have the callers use the new cfile_ routines for
    reporting errors.
    
    This requires that the "write failure alert box" routine take the
    *input* file name as an argument, so that, on a merge, if the problem is
    that a record from a given input file can't be written out to the type
    of output file we're generating, the input file name can be given, along
    with the record number in that file.

    The goal is to figure out the U-RNTI for UEs in DCH to
    preserve a single continous RLC session when the UE moves to FACH
    (Since the UE ID in FACH is derived from the identity found in the
    MAC layer, which is sometimes the U-RNTI)
    UMTS RRC dissector now defines a single 'umts rrc private data'
    structure as the way to access the actx->private_data field

    on the magnitude of the value (for MIN/MAX/SUM calculations). Internally
    the numbers are stored as integers (microseconds).
    
    The Qt UI did not have this formatting feature yet and would therefore
    display the values as-is (in microseconds). This patch rescales the Y
    value and appends an appropriate label (s, ms or us).
    
    With multiple graphs, rescaling is disabled completely for simplicity
    (GTK+ would still try to find an appropriate unit prefix if there are
    multiple time graphs).

    netflow: fix undefined shift
    
    Treat any prefix length larger than 32 as 32 (effectively not masking
    anything) and treat a zero-length prefix as the empty mask (matching
    anything).

    Eliminate an unneded member of a wtap_dumper.
    
    The only place the time stamp precision is used is in the libpcap code,
    where it determines whether to write out microsecond-precision or
    nanosecond-precision time stamps; we can determine that by looking at
    the type/subtype field, which is also part of that structure, so do
    that.
    
    We weren't setting it consistently - we were only setting it in libpcap
    and a few other capture file writers, and not in other capture file
    writers - and none of the writers other than libpcap used it.

    Qt: Provide both file save and open preferences
    
    This is a breaking change.
    
    prefs_register_filename_preference hasn't been differentiating
    between files to be saved and ones to be opened.
    
    On GTK, a neutral dialog is used, so no problems there.
    On Qt, a save dialog has been always used, even in dissectors that
    were reading configuration files without modification.
    
    prefs_register_filename_preference now takes an argument to indicate
    whether UI could be a save dialog with a warning on overwriting
    a file, or whether it's a general purpose open file dialog.
    
    Qt now does this. Previously no warning was shown on overwriting a file,
    so it may be used for opening files too without irritating the user.
    This has been changed, as non-destructive reads should now use
    the open dialog.
    
    Dissectors were changed accordingly.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Apr 16 20:47:34 2017 -0700

    Clean up documentation and help messages for protocol enabling/disabling.
    
    List all of --enable-protocol, --disable-protocol, --enable-heuristic,
    and --disable-heuristic in the SYNOPSIS section of the man pages.
    
    Undent after the list of taps for the -z option, so the following
    options are at the same indentation as other options.
    
    List --enable-protocol in the DESCRIPTION, above --disable-protocol.
    
    Include --enable-protocol in the help message.

    Remove unnecessary tap.
    
    The tap was just a trick to get fields and protocols registered as being
    of interest.  Now that we have mechanisms by which postdissectors can
    explicitly register fields and protocols as being of interest, and are
    using that, the trick is no longer needed.

    Builds on the macOS buildbot do *not* fail.
    
    So put the result of Lemon in the MATE plugin into the release tarball,

    VRRP v2 in Cisco routers can use "Keyed MD5" for IP authentication, and
    such packets are now dissected slightly better.
    
    The offset of the MD5 digest value pointed out by this patch can be
    validated against Cisco's IOU software by using the IOU's "debug vrrp

commit 581db4c
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Apr 16 01:23:16 2017 -0700

    Get rid of some generated files with "make distclean".
    
    register.c, and the plugin.c for various plugins, are generated by tools
    that must be available to do a build, and aren't distributed as part of
    the source tarball.  That means "make distclean" should remove them.  Do
    so.

    Squelch some compiler warnings.
    
    Cast an ssize_t value to unsigned int before subtracting it from an
    unsigned int.  The value is already known to be >= 0 and <= the value
    from which we're subtracting it, and that latter value is an unsigned
    int, so it's guaranteed to fit into an unsigned int.  (ssize_t can be
    bigger than unsigned int.)

    being an "amalgamation":

    although, unlike SQLite, the individual bits of the amalgamation don't

    Use proto_get_finfo_ptr_array() rather than proto_find_finfo().
    
    As the comments say, proto_find_finfo() is slower than
    proto_get_finfo_ptr_array(), as it has to scan the entire tree, and,
    given that we're priming the tree with the fields we need (which we
    *have* to do to *guarantee* that we'll get the fields we want;
    requesting that a protocol tree be constructed isn't sufficient, and
    asking for a "visible" protocol tree is overkill),
    proto_get_finfo_ptr_array() will work.

    same in "wlan_host_get_filter_type". While at it, remove the check for

    Add an API to let a postdissector specify fields whose values it needs.
    
    Currently, this is only used to determine whether a protocol tree needs
    to be built on the first pass or not - if there are postdissectors that
    need fields, it does - but eventually we should be able to use it to
    prime the dissection to deliver those fields in cases where we don't
    need the *entire* protocol tree (rather than using a hack such as
    cooking up a fake tap with a fake filter to do that).
    
    Update MATE and TRANSUM to use it.
    
    Clean up code to check whether we need a protocol tree, and add comments
    before that code indicating, in each case, what the criteria are.
    
    The array of postdissectors includes a length, so we don't need to
    separately keep track of the number of postdissectors.
    
    Clean up indentation while we're at it.

    cmake: fix sporadic WSDG build failure on Windows
    
    The Windows builds (using msbuild) fail sporadically when building
    documentation (target developer_guides). The problem is that the targets
    "developer_guide_pdf_a4" and "developer_guide_html" both depend on
    developer-guide.xml and msbuild does not notice that the file has
    already been generated by the generate_developer-guide.xml target.
    
    For a discussion of the problem, see
    https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/16767
    
    To fix this, remove the "developer-guide.xml" dependency from
    "developer_guide_xyz" (to prevent these targets from triggering building
    "developer-guide.xml"). Instead, depend on a generated
    "developer-guide.xml-stamp" file which is created by the
    "generate_developer-guide.xml" target (but do *not* add it as output of
    this target, otherwise we will have the original problem again).
    
    This workaround is restricted to the MSVC generators because otherwise
    it would trigger a CMP0058 policy warning when used with Ninja.

    netlink: let subdissectors handle the netlink header
    
    Let subdissectors handle parsing and addition of the Netlink header
    instead of doing this before calling subdissectors. After this patch:
    
     - Protocol filters like "netlink-netfilter" can be used to match
       packets (previously only a text item was added to the tree).
     - Subdissectors have more freedom in modifying the type field, so now
       it shows the correct type directly rather than "Message type:
       Protocol-specific".
     - netfilter: the type fields are now actually linked to a tvb,
       previously it was linked to a NULL tvb.
     - netfilter: fix unintended rejection of packets (the length should
       have been added to the offset, otherwise it would fallback to the
       data dissector).
     - Now subdissectors will not be called for control messages (so the
       netlink-conntrack.pcap sample now shows "Netlink" instead of "Netlink
       route" for the "End of dump" control message).

commit 2c44a7f
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sat Apr 8 12:45:19 2017 -0700

    Clean up handling of enabled/disabled protocols/heuristic dissectors.
    
    Add a "report a warning message" routine to the "report_err" code in
    libwsutil, and rename files and routines appropriately, as they don't
    only handle errors any more.
    
    Have a routine read_enabled_and_disabled_protos() that reads all the
    files that enable or disable protocols or heuristic dissectors, enables
    and disables them based on the contents of those files, and reports
    errors itself (as warnings) using the new "report a warning message"
    routine.  Fix that error reporting to report separately on the disabled
    protocols, enabled protocols, and heuristic dissectors files.
    
    Have a routine to set up the enabled and disabled protocols and
    heuristic dissectors from the command-line arguments, so it's done the
    same way in all programs.
    
    If we try to enable or disable an unknown heuristic dissector via a
    command-line argument, report an error.
    
    Update a bunch of comments.
    
    Update the name of disabled_protos_cleanup(), as it cleans up
    information for disabled *and* enabled protocols and for heuristic
    dissectors.
    
    Support the command-line flags to enable and disable protocols and
    heuristic dissectors in tfshark.

    checkhf: handle C++-style comments
    
    "tools/checkhf.pl epan/dissectors/packet-umts_fp.c" gave this error:
    
        Complex regular subexpression recursion limit (32766) exceeded at tools/checkhf.pl line 273.
    
    This is caused by the comment "// ... Indicator's ..." which failed to
    match the single-quoted string and caused "catastrophic backtracking".
    Solution to fix this case is to disallow unescaped newlines (add "\n" to
    the negated character class). Additionally, add logic to remove
    C++-style comments for completeness.
    
    Tested against all epan/dissectors/packet-*.c files, the only difference
    in output is this umts_fp case, the running time has not regressed.

    Qt: Remember exact position of selected item in tree
    
    When switching between packets, the first field at a level would be
    selected. This is annoying if you have similarly structured trees (like
    TLVs or text labels).
    
    Combined with something like bug 13533, this causes erratic jumping. Fix
    this by incorporating the level position in the path.

    Qt: fix tracer and selection of packet in IO Graph
    
    Do not assume first graph in the list, pick the first visible graph.
    This (1) fixes the tracer which would otherwise show a marker at an
    non-obvious position that is not located on the graph and (2) fixes the
    GoToPacket action when clicking on the graph.

    Initiator is always master. Only Role switch event may change it.
    Improve "Accept Connection Request" to avoid users confusion
    by using new specification description:
    0x00 Become the Master for this connection. The LM will perform the role switch.
    0x01 Remain the Slave for this connection. The LM will NOT perform the role switch.
    
    Field "Role" is now splitted from: "bthci_cmd.role"
    and it name is "bthci_cmd.acr.role".

commit 12434e9
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Apr 2 15:32:39 2017 -0700

    Fix dissection of Get Info requests.
    
    If the length of the input buffer is zero, it means there *is* no input
    buffer; don't use the offset of that buffer plus the length as the
    offset past the end of the end of the packet, as both will probably be
    zero.  Also, for a request to get quota info, report a warning if
    there's no input buffer, as MS-SMB2 seems to say there must be one.
    
    If the length of the input buffer is *not* zero, ignore the iput buffer
    for requests other than requests to get quota info or full extended
    attribute info, as MS-SMB2 says a server should do that.  Otherwise,
    make sure the offset of the input buffer is past the end of the
    fixed-length part of the request and the offset+length doesn't overflow
    or go past the end of the message.
    
    While we're at it, for some routines that return a "next offset", use
    that return value rather than wiring in the length in the caller.

    BGP: Remove redundant  text in Path Attributes.
    
    Also added display of lower-order four bits of the Attribute Flags ("unused").
    
     Current implementation of displaying path attribute flags shows flag description twice if the flag was set.
    
     For example, with Optional and Length set, the attribute flags were displayed as follows:
    
                 Flags: 0x90, Optional, Length: Optional, Non-transitive, Complete, Extended Length
                     1... .... = Optional: Optional
                     .0.. .... = Transitive: Non-transitive
                     ..0. .... = Partial: Complete
                     ...1 .... = Length: Extended length
    
     Now they are displayed as follows:
    
                Flags: 0x90, Optional, Extended-Length, Non-transitive, Complete
                    1... .... = Optional: Set
                    .0.. .... = Transitive: Not set
                    ..0. .... = Partial: Not set
                    ...1 .... = Extended-Length: Set
                    .... 0000 = Unused: 0x0

    Check before setting the length of a protocol item.
    
    Don't assume that 8 + {32-bit unsigned integer} won't overflow.  Use
    tvb_ensure_bytes_exist() to ensure that the data in question is present;
    it also checks for overflows.
    
    Also, set the length after we've succeeded in dissecting the item - if
    we throw an exception, it's because we don't have all the data, so the
    tvb_ensure_bytes_exist() would have failed, but this way we at least get
    to dissect what data we *do* have.

    Fix some dissection errors.
    
    "XXX supported" for a metric type is a Boolean, not an int; add it as
    such.
    
    Add the value of the item without the extra bits.
    
    The length of an address prefix is in semi-octets (nibbles/hex digits),
    not in octets.

    checkAPIs: improve trailing item suggestion for XXX_string
    
    Tighten the check (do not just check for "0,NULL}};" but also
    "{0,NULL}};" in case someone decides to use "{0x10,NULL}};" as trailing
    item. Improve the suggestion, "{NULL,NULL}" is better for string_string
    than "{0,NULL}".
    
    For now treat 0 the same as NULL since files like packet-fix.h would
    need editing otherwise. Accept octal notation for value_string since
    packet-nfs.c uses this in nfs2_mode_names.

    dns: prevent repeatedly overwriting resolved entries
    
    When a packet contains multiple conflicting names for the same address,
    it would result in modification of the resolved name every time this DNS
    packet is selected. In Qt, this causes a periodic (one second)
    redissection of the current (DNS!) packet which interferes with user
    interaction. To avoid this, only add the address on the first visit.

Date:   Thu Mar 30 17:48:58 2017 -0700

    Distinguish between the two flavors of ITU-T AFIs.
    
    As ISO 8348/X.213 Annex A says:
    
    A.5.2.1.2 Format and allocation of the IDI
    
    A specific combination of IDI format and DSP abstract syntax is
    associated with each allocated AFI value, as summarized for use in
    individual addresses in Table A.4 (the corresponding AFI values for use
    in group addresses is found via Table A.2).  Two AFI values are
    associated with each combination that involves a variable-length IDI
    format.  In each case, both of the AFI values identify the same
    combination of IDI format and DSP abstract syntax.  The numerically
    lower AFI value is used when the first significant digit in the IDI is
    non-zero.  The numerically greater AFI value is used when the first
    significant digit in the IDI is zero.
    
    and A.5.3 talks further about this.

    Note that calling setFilter with an empty string is pretty useless,
    especially since the filter is initialized later, so remove it.
    The choice for IOG_ITEM_UNIT_FIRST is quite arbitrary and needed because
    setValueUnits reads the "old" (uninitialized) value.

    Prevent crash/assert on access to "uninitialized" device.if_info.name.
    
    While this is one possible way to fix it, it probably is not the "right"
    way to do it. I just don't know which one would be right. I regard
    several options to be cleaner:
    - Remove if_info from interface_t altogether and add the required fields
      to interface_t directly.
    - Never use device.if_info.name but always use device.name (same with
      friendly_name)
    - Initialize both fields the same (same with friendly_name)
    - Also not nice: device is optically a struct, not a pointer. So into the
      function, when we create a new struct (that's where the error "is made"),
      the same name continues to be used.
    
    Not improving my confidence into my solution:
    - I haven't bee able to figure out why the automated Windows builds don't
      crash/assert.
    
    Last but not least: The two qt/gtk functions should probably have their common
    core extracted into a common function.

    standard I have says that the conversion from integral to bool does

    to the dialog and be careful to avoid infinite recursions.
    
    Life of a signal for InterfaceFrame:
    
        ui->interfaceTree->selectionModel emits selectionChanged
        -> slot InterfaceFrame::interfaceTreeSelectionChanged
          -> emits InterfaceFrame::itemSelectionChanged
            -> slot MainWelcome::interfaceSelected
               -> emits MainWelcome::interfacesChanged
                  -> slot CaptureInterfacesDialog::interfaceSelected
                     (updats dialog selection)
    
    Life of a signal for CaptureInterfacesDialog:
    
        ui->interfaceTree emits itemSelectionChanged
        -> slot CaptureInterfacesDialog::interfaceSelected
           (emission of next signal because sender is ui->interfaceTree)
           -> emits CaptureInterfacesDialog::interfacesChanged
              -> slot InterfaceFrame::updateSelectedInterfaces
                 (updates main screen selection)
    
    This should probably be updated to model/view with shared selection
    model in the future.

    Fix up time encodings.
    
    Add some new encodings for absolute time stamps, and use them as
    appropriate; this fixes some cases where the time stamps in question
    were being dissected incorrectly.
    
    For the encodings with seconds and 1/2^32s of a second, don't
    arbitrarily give only microsecond resolution; 2^32 is greater than 1
    million, and, in fact, at least some NTP RFCs explicitly talk about time
    resolution greater than 1 microsecond.
    
    Update references in the RELOAD dissector to reflect the documents in
    question having been updated and published as RFCs.

    Don't speak of RTPS time_t as an "NTP" time.
    
    It's some weird hybrid of UN*X time and NTP time stamps, using UN*X's
    epoch and NTP's seconds/fractions split.  I'm sure they had their
    reasons for not using something like struct timespec or regular NTP
    time, and instead inventing something that's halfway in between them.

    From a look at the libosmocom code, time stamps in

    part in units of 1/2^32s of a second.

    Qt: add cache proxy model for Voip Calls dialog
    
    When a capture file is reloaded, the information stored in
    VoipCallsInfoModel is invalidated. Add another cache layer to fix this:
    
        VoipCallsInfoModel          wraps around raw data (invalid on close)
        CacheProxyModel             NEW: use prev. data or cache on close
        VoipCallsInfoSortedModel    provided sorting, etc.
        VoipCallsDialog             actual user of model (callTreeView)
    
    This also fixes a UAF after a file was closed, and when a call is
    selected (that got worse with the last model/view patch and is "fixed"
    in this patch with the caching layer. Note that the Flow sequence and
    Play Streams dialog are not that useful when the file is closed).

    Qt: refactor Voip Calls Dialog into Model/View
    
    Functional improvements:
    
     - "Time of day" option is now propagated to the CSV/YAML export.
     - The sorting order is preserved in the CSV/YAML export.
    
    Other changes:
    
     - Convert column name identifiers to enum.
     - CSV output will now always be quoted (previously numbers like packet
       count were not quoted, but since CSV has no numeric type it should
       be OK to add quotes). Side-effect of model design decision.
     - Instead of clearing the widgets and re-adding all calls, now it will
       add new calls to the model. Not tested with a live capture, if the
       column data can change, maybe a dataChanged signal is needed.
    
    Due to this patch, it should be easier to add a filter for finding calls
    easier (e.g. by From, IP, etc.).
    
    Note: extra QList is used in the model to ensure a O(1) lookup of calls
    (rather than O(n) for GQueue).

    RTP streams dialog as it is modeless when called from the menu in the main
    window with a stream packet selected.
    
    - Action 'Next problem packet' triggers an infinite loop when there are no
    'problem packets' and first packet is selected when calling the action.
    
    - Crosshairs not implemented in RTP player/crosshairs context menu item not

    androiddump: Fix tcpdump op prec bug with used_buffer_length calc
    
    androiddump reads data from tcpdump in chunks that not necessarily
    match packet sizes. Whenever a partly read packet is found in buffers
    more data is read and the number of used bytes in buffer is updated.
    The calculation of used_buffer_length is wrong though leading to most
    packets are read and thrown away.
    
    Problem fixed by correcting an operator precedence mistake where
    used_buffer_length would only be increaded with 0 or 1 insted of
    actual number of read bytes.

commit 40a5fb5
Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Fri Mar 10 03:46:53 2017 +0100

    Restore interface selection after interface refresh
    
    Remember which interfaces were selected for the next capture and restore
    the selection (note that only active capture devices are stored in
    "ifaces", so simply querying that list does not work).
    
    The original change tried to fix duplicate devices (which were added
    from "ifaces" to "all_ifaces") by clearing "ifaces", this patch tries to
    fix that by ignoring all non-PIPE devices while preserving "ifaces".
    
    Now after refreshing the interfaces list in Qt, the selection in the
    Manage Interfaces dialog is preserved. Removal of the bluetooth0
    interface+refresh does hide the interface. Read+refresh does add the
    interface (and preserve the selected state).

    Remove echld/.
    
    It has been unsupported for some years and when talking about removing it
    in the past I received some positive and no negative feedback.
    
    There is one instance of echld left:
    capchild/capture_sync.c:                 * echld might have already reaped the child.
    
    Can that case be removed or should be comment be updated to something more
    accurate? (left for a separate patch)

    MySQL: Bugfix state handling
    
    A "conversation" is created for MySQL to store "conversation data" including
    current state.  The problem is that it's updated every time a packet is dissected
    so depending on how packets are viewed, dissection may change.
    Fix that by only allowing conversation state to be set on first pass and have
    the state cached with each individual pdu, keyed by tvb_raw_offset() (the key
    when you have multiple pdus in a TCP packet).

    All users of the ELEM_OPT_TLV and ELEM_MAND_TV macros pass an empty string ("")
    for the elem_name_addition parameter, so it can never be NULL. The Coverity
    warning was about a superfluous check (elem_name_addition[0]=='\0'). All of
    these checks are superfluous anyway since both branches yield an empty string.

Author: Michal Kubecek <mkubecek@suse.cz>
Date:   Fri Mar 10 08:59:02 2017 +0100

    netlink: support legacy dump request messages
    
    Some legacy tools, including iproute2 < 3.9, issue shorter RTM_GETLINK
    and RTM_GETADDR dump queries which only contain struct rtgenmsg rather
    than struct ifinfomsg. As noted in kernel comment in rtnl_dump_ifinfo(),
    these legacy requests will be (even with attributes) always shorter than
    struct ifinfomsg so that they are easy to detect.
    
    Similar problem can be observed with tools using nl_rtgen_request()
    function from libnl3; this also affects other RTM_GET* types.
    
    If such legacy message is detected by length shorter than expected data
    structure, parse it as this legacy version with (1-byte) struct
    rtgenmsg so that it's shown as intended rather than as malformed.

    Don't cast to a too-large size.
    
    The maximum record length is 255*128 + 127 = 32767; that fits in a
    guint32, which is large enough to support the biggest packet we'd ever
    support without stretching several size values to 64 bits.
    
    It's not a size of an object in memory, so it doesn't have to be a
    size_t, and a size_t could be too large to fit in the record sizes we're
    using.
    
    Just cast to guint32.

Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Sat Mar 4 01:40:51 2017 +0100

    Introduce "bytes_string" type, similar to "value_string"
    
    In order to map arbitrary byte buffers to strings, introduce a new
    "bytes_string" type. Since "bytes_to_str" is already used for other
    purposes, name the generic function "bytesval_to_str" instead similar to
    the name( "val_to_str").
    
    Accept "size_t" as length parameter since this is what is returned by
    the "sizeof" operator. Do not add a "try_bytesval_to_str_idx" variant
    since this pattern is not needed for now. Add a variant to match the
    prefix since this is currently expected by the ISAKMP dissector.

    1) Its caller closes it, and closing a closed pcap_t can cause Bad

    2) We're trying to get an error string from it after we're closing it,
    which won't work well, either.

    have it iff we have pcap_create()).

    ftypes: create a set_value union
    
    struct _ftype_t contains a number of pointers to set_value_...()
    functions. For each pre-defined ftype_t, only one of these pointers
    is != NULL.
    
    As the comment already says, we should move these functions into a
    union. ftenum_t ftype will be used for selecting the correct function
    pointer from the union.
    
    Create a set_value union and move the FvalueSetByteArrayFunc pointer
    into the union. Update fvalue_set_byte_array() accordingly. Check
    that the fvalue_t parameter is of the correct type.

    lua: improve FileHandler:[seek_]read behavior and documentation
    
    WSLUA documents FileHandler:read as returning a boolean or integer.
    Ignore strings, do not treat strings as number even if it is possible.
    
    Remove undocumented feature of FileHandler:seek_read that used returned
    strings as the frame data. Use FrameInfo:read_data instead. This avoids
    interpreting numbers as data which caused surprising behavior when
    combining with FileHandler:read.
    
    Documentation has been improved to document the return value, this is
    consistent with the documentation in the WSLUA tests.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Mar 5 18:11:22 2017 -0800

    Rename a data structure to reflect what it represents.
    
    The structure called a pcap_options structure doesn't (only) hold
    options for a packet capture; it holds all information about a
    particular device, pipe, or socket from which we're capturing.  Rename
    it capture_src - and rename all the pointer variables that point to
    something of that type to pcap_src from pcap_opts.

commit b7e9582
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Fri Mar 3 20:34:59 2017 -0800

    Fix the calculation of the number of levels in the radix tree.
    
    The algorithm being used calculated the number of levels in a
    1024-leaf-node tree as being 2, but it's 1 - 0 elements means 0 levels,
    1 through 1024 elements means 1 level, 1025 through 1024^2 elements
    means 2 levels, etc..  With a count of 1024, the loop would bump the
    level count from 0 to 1, and divide the element count by 1024, yielding
    1, so the loop would not terminate, and the level count would them go
    from 1 to 2 and the element count would go to 0.
    
    This could cause problems if exactly 1024 packets were seen.
    
    Just use an if chain, similar to the one used when adding elements to
    the tree.

    SIP: Add digest verification functionality
    
    Added functionality to verify SIP authorization lines. With this functionality
    it's possible to find faulty passwords that were added to configuration by
    automatic processes (eg having unescaped '&' characters in XML config
    files) resulting in authorization failures that cannot be diagnosed
    otherwise.
    Other uses include bug hunting in SIP stacks.

    Qt: reduce minimum window size requirement
    
    Strip some padding from the main welcome screen and lower the minimum
    width to allow the window to be shrinked. Even when a capture file was
    open, the minimum dimensions from the main welcome screen would apply.
    
    The minimum dimensions on Arch Linux with Qt 5.8.0-5 and Plasma 5.9.2
    (with the default Breeze theme) for a window have changes as follows:
     - main screen/pcap loaded: 746x626 -> 702x590
     - with search bar opened:  826x658 -> 826x622
    (These numbers exclude 35x10 window decoration.)

    packets without multiple data sources). Remove this artificial
    requirement and allow the packet bytes view to be resized to show
    nothing (except for possible data sources tabs).
    
    This makes it easier to fit more packets and details for screenshots.

    Squelch a warning from VS Code Analysis.
    
    It warns that a 32-bit value is being shifted left and then converted to
    a 64-bit type; presumably it means "this might overflow and not give you
    the result you expect".  That's unlikely to be the case here, as few
    UN*X file systems have a recommended I/O block size > 2^30, but we might
    as well throw in a cast so the convert-to-a-64-bit-type is done first.

    Records in a properly formatted NetScaler file shouldn't go past the end

    formatted.
    
    NetScaler 3.x files allow record bodies to go past the end of a page,
    but 1.x and 2.x files don't, so treat record headers that go past the
    end of a page, and record bodies in 1.x and 2.x files that go past the
    end of a page, as errors.

Date:   Mon Feb 27 23:47:11 2017 +0100

    radius: fix use-after-free after recent memleak fixes
    
    The same data is referenced by the ID-to-name and name-to-ID mapping, so
    be make sure that the ID mapping is responsible (as the name mapping is
    just used for duplicate detection and while parsing dictionary files).
    
    Still to be done is fixing duplicate attribute numbers (by adding
    support for OIDs and changing TLV attribute type IDs to OIDs) and fixing
    duplicate attribute names (by prefixing the Vendor Names to them).
    Also not handled is fixing Value memleaks.

    IEEE 802.11: Handle Atheros padding
    
    For some unknown reason between 802.11 protocol fields end and LLC
    protocol field start two octets of padding may appear. These octets
    (value 0x00) were observed on the OLPC laptop, heuristically detected
    and marked as OLPC mysterious stuff.
    
    It seems that Atheros chipset drivers also show this behaviour,
    although the padding is not 0x0000, but seem to be a duplicate of the
    sequence control field. This is now also heuristically detected and
    marked more generically as payload padding.

    This commit also contains minor fixes to doc/README.extcap, it's now more aligned to the

    Added tshark -T jsonraw output
    json2pcap.py (can be used for basic packet editing by modifying json)
    
    The modification in tshark -T json -x and new tshark -T jsonraw output
    add into  hex-data output in JSON also information on which position
    each field is dissected in the original frame, what is the field length,
    bitmask (for not byte aligned fields) and type. This information can be
    used for latter processing. One use-case is json2pcap script which
    assembles the protocol layers back together from upper to lowers layers,
    which allows the basic packet modification/editing/rewriting.

    Reduce number of fwrite when writing pcap-ng EPB.
    
    According to callgrind with the patch dumping 3000 pakets the number of
    calls to write_to_file is reduced from 11541 to 9000 reducing the number
    of lr from 4 681 518 to 4 314 101.
    
    If the buffer holding the packet was guaranteed to be padded to 32 bit
    boundary the code could be simplified and if there was space "in front"
    for the packet header it would be even better.

    Make MIPv6 options into a dissector table.
    
    This provides external access for dissectors and plugins to provide their
    own implementation of MIPv6 options.
    Also cleaned up some of the "offset defines" and just went with relative
    increments for the option functions.

    The mystery pixel issue has probably been mysteriously solved earlier
    because the adjustments does not work as expected now.
    
    This fixes an issue where one of the panes increases with 1 pixel at
    startup and when changing profile using layout type 3, 4, 5 and 6
    (selection number 1, 4, 5 and 6 in “Preferences -> Appearance -> Layout”).

    A user reported that the TNS dissector would show "Malformed Packet" in

    however had no trace of the issue.
    
    It turns out that proto_tree_add_item_new_ret_length did not correctly
    set the length. Test case (based on pcap from SampleCaptures wiki):

    file-pcapng: Add support for inspecting Apple's PKTAP enhanced pcapng files
    
    This patch augments the MIME based file-pcapng dissector to allow one to
    more easily examine pcapng blocks that contain Darwin Process Information.
    
    With this patch one can dissect and inspect, albeit as a MIME object, the
    Darwin process information elements contained within an Apple augmented
    pcapng file:
    
    $ wireshark -X read_format:'MIME Files Format' -r bug12587.pktap.pcapng
    
    $ tshark -V -X read_format:'MIME Files Format' -r bug12587.pktap.pcapng | egrep '^    Block:|Darwin .* =' | less
    
    Apple's macOS provides an enhanced tcpdump with a pktap interface option
    that supports the collection, display and storing of Darwin process and/or
    service class information related to each captured packet. Using Apple's
    pktap interface during a live capture the process information may be
    revealed using Apple's tcpdump -k [metadata] option.
    
    Apple's tcpdump -k option augments tcpdump's standard report with an
    additional parenthesized () set of information inserted after the packet
    timestamp. If the capture file actually contains Darwin process
    information, Apple's tcpdump -k could include the interface name (or
    interface id), process id, process name, process_uuid, service, and/or
    direction for each packet depending on the value of the -k's [metadata]
    argument provided (if any).
    
    If the Apple tcpdump trace is captured to disk, the Darwin based process
    and service information is saved in pcapng format augmented with several
    new Enhanced Packet Block options (32779, 32780, 32781) along with a new
    block type (0x80000001) called here a Darwin Process Event Block (DPEB).
    The Darwin Process Event Block is used in a manner similar to a pcapng
    IDB in that it contains process event information that is referenced by
    later EPB's via the EPB options Darwin DPEB ID (32769) and Darwin EDPEB
    ID (32871). EPBs may also include the Darwin Service Class option (32770)
    which includes a numeric value that maps to a mnemonic service class.
    
    A PKTAP enhanced pcapng file can later be read back in with Apple's tcpdump
    along and the help of its -k option to display the original Darwin Process
    Information. Packets collected using Apple's remote virtual interface
    (rvictl)[1] from iOS devices can also contain Darwin Process Information.
    
    Note: This is a first step to help determine what will be necessary to
    eventually display any available Darwin Process Information within
    the Frame tree when an Apple PKTAP enhanced pcapng file is opened
    naturally in Wireshark and not as a MIME object.

    RSVD TUNNEL_SCSI bugfix: SCSI payload is not dissected for request packets
    
    For SCSI packets tunnelled via RSVD, the logic of
    SCSI Payload dissection should be:
    -For SCSI IN transfer type (DataIn=1), display SCSI Payload of reply packet only.
    -For SCSI OUT transfer type (DataOut=0), display SCSI Payload of request packet only.
    -For non-data transfer type (DataIn=2) don't display SCSI payload even if DataBuffer is non-empty.
    
    Minor fix: display RSVD DataBuffer BEFORE SCSI Payload in response packets.
    If SCSI dissector failed (malformad packet), binary DataBuffer blob
    will be still displayed in SVHDX_TUNNEL_SCSI_RESPONSE subtree.

    Convert IEEE802.11 tagged fields into a dissector table
    
    One GIANT switch statement is a little difficult to maintain, so convert each
    case into its own function and add them to a dissector table.  Many of the
    case statements were already their own function, but signatures needed to
    be converted into dissector_handle_t
    -1 was uses as the protocol for the dissector handles because there isn't
    a need to be associated with a protocol.  This also allows third-parties
    and plugins to add tagged fields outside of Wireshark using the new
    dissector table.

    This means that on Windows, if our parent has closed stdin when we call

    definition, it must not be zero.  Make sure it's at least big enough for
    the packet header itself plus one segment header.

Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Thu Feb 9 15:00:19 2017 +0100

    Make Libgcrypt a mandatory dependency
    
    Removed all guards for HAVE_LIBGCRYPT, change autotools and CMake to
    error out if it is not available. Update release notes, developer
    documentation and README with the new status. Clarify relation with
    GnuTLS in macosx-setup.sh. Install Libgcrypt via brew script.
    
    Motivation for this change is that many dissectors depend on Libgcrypt
    and having it optional increases the maintenance burden (there have been
    several compile issues in the past due to the optional status).
    Furthermore, wsutil has crypto code that can be replaced by Libgcrypt.

Author: Noel Power <noel.power@suse.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 12 05:52:23 2017 -0500

    mswsp: Numerous bugfixes
    
    1. Fix display of CTableColumn.StatusUsed & CTableColumn.LengthUsed
    Both StatusUsed and LenghtUsed members were displayed as 2 byte length
    values instead of single byte values.
    
    2. Fix minor spelling mistake
    
    3. display correct address(s) for array of address values
    
    4. Use correct minimum CTableColumn size
    
    This is followup patch for patch already provided for bug 13299.
    The previous minimum value neglated to take into account the
    CFullPropSpec structure (which is on the wire) but is represtented
    as a string in the internal CTableColumn structure. Note: this doesn't
    make any difference to the effectiveness of the previous patch but should
    avoid confusion if someone later actually investigates the correct minimum
    size.
    
    5. Fix CPMCREATEQUERY message parsing
    
    Following a query and subsequent clarification from dochelp@microsoft.com
    the MS-WSP specification document was found to be incorrect.
    
    CPMCreateQueryIn
          |
          ---> CSortSet
    
    should instead eventually point to CSortSet via the following msg structure
    
    CPMCreateQueryIn
          |
          ---> CInGroupSortAggregSets
               |

commit 520a1b2
Author: Jim Young <jyoung@gsu.edu>
Date:   Mon Jan 30 02:45:15 2017 -0500

    Make the capture file's interface description filterable
    
    This patch introduces the frame.interface_description field.
    
    While testing this new functionality it became obvious that we have
    a non-optimal interaction between the existing cfile.c's
    cap_file_get_interface_name(), the recently added frame.interface_name
    field and this new frame.interface_description field.
    
    The string returned from cap_file_get_interface_name() may in fact
    come from one of three different sources: the idb's interface name
    (if it exists) or the idb's interface description (if that exists)
    or a default text of "unknown".  The string ultimately becomes the
    rame.interface_name whether or not the idb had an interface name
    option to begin with.  This behavior does not allow one to test for
    the simple presence of frame.interface_name.  The new peer function
    cap_file_get_interface_description() added by this patch returns
    NULL instead of "unknown" if the idb does not have an interface
    description.  Should cap_file_get_interface_name() be similarly
    modified to return NULL if the idb does not have an interface name?

    ssl-utils: add vector length validation for Client Hello
    
    Use ssl_add_vector to process DTLS Cookie, cipher_suites,
    compression_methods, client_hello_extension_list. Removed some checks
    (like cipher_suite_length > 0) since (per specification) these must be
    non-empty (if this is not the case, then at worst an empty tree is
    visible).

    Make sure pid_t is defined.
    
    Just as we include <windows.h> on Windows to get HANDLE defined, include
    <sys/types.h> on UN*X to get pid_t defined.
    
    We don't seem to need this (yet) on the master and 2.2 branches, but it
    looks as if it might be necessary on the 2.0 branch.  Do it everywhere.

    TLS13: update NewSessionTicket dissection
    
    The new ticket_age_add field resulted in a dissector exception. With
    this fixed, the tls13-18-picotls-earlydata.pcap capture can now be fully
    decrypted.
    
    Also add validation for the ticket length (using ssl_add_vector).

    TLS13: support Early Data and accept CLIENT_EARLY_TRAFFIC_SECRET
    
    Update "early_data" extension to draft 18 (context field is gone).
    Add support for "client_early_traffic_secret" to the keylog.
    Support decryption of 0-RTT data (required handling cipher in Client
    Hello and handling of "end_of_early_data" alert).
    
    Tested with tls13-18-picotls-earlydata.pcap, early data decrypts
    correctly. (The server data is messed up, but that is possibly the
    result of broken NewSessionTicket handling which throws a dissector
    exception and thus breaks the record sequence number.)

    ssl-utils: refactor "length" parameter into "offset_end" for extensions
    
    Change all Hello extension dissector functions to accept the end of the
    extension rather than the extension length. The changes are quite
    mechanical: change "ext_len" to "ext_len = offset_end - offset".
    
    Remove some "offset += ext_len" to ensure that additional unparsed data
    is warned for.
    
    The intent is that (extension) dissectors can easier check for overflow
    (offset + 2 < offset_end). Later changes should remove "guint ext_len"
    with appropriate changes (like replacing by ssl_add_vector).

    ssl-utils: add helper for validating Variable Length Vectors
    
    Currently variable length vectors are mostly unchecked with issues
    ignored (see various "XXX - expert info"). In order to detect possible
    attacks (and catch dissector issues), add helpers that extract the
    vector length and that validate that a vector is correctly terminated.
    Further dissection of a vector stops when not enough data is available.
    
    The KeyShare extension and Extension itself are modified as a start,
    more should follow. Future work should also ensure that the return value
    represents the length after dissection (which should not exceed the
    length). Also, the length field needs to be converted to an "offset_end"
    value to ease overflow checking (length = offset_end - offset).

    "llc.bluetooth_pid" is now placed in bluetooth-file, it seems to be
    fine, but there is a need to avoid terrible/horrible scream from

    wsutil/sober128: remove unused macros and functions
    
    Removed unused macros/functions that are apparently imported from
    LibTomCrypt, only LOAD32L and STORE32L are needed. Remove code that
    tries to distinguish between little/big endian, since WORDS_BIGENDIAN
    was never defined, this would never have worked on big endian anyway.
    
    Remove the special ROR "optimization" for GCC on i386, modern compilers
    are able to optimize it to exactly the same thing. The generic
    LOAD32L/STORE32L macros are less optimized (as can be seen in the
    generated code), but this was not noticable in the mean running time.
    
    Tested with the packet capture from bug 3232, the result is the same:
    
        tshark -ocorosync_totemnet.private_keys:example.com -r corosync-totemsrp--key:example.com--2nodes.pcap -Vx

    GHashtable -> wmem_map conversions
    
    Many of the register_init_routine/register_cleanup_routine functions
    are for initializing and cleaning up a GHashtable.
    wmem_map_new_autoreset can do that automatically, so convert many
    of the simple cases.

    dtls: avoid possible NULL deref
    
    "decoder->flow" could result in a NULL pointer dereference if a null
    cipher was in use (caught by Clang static analyzer).
    
    Answering the questions:
    - DTLS records fragments do not need to be reassembled, thus there is no
      flow. The Handshake messages have their own fragment_offset field and
      thus there is no need to maintain an extra flow.
    - Actually one datagram can contain multiple records (RFC 6347, 4.1.1),
      but this is not implemented yet. The key can however not be "0"
      though, it must match the offsets from ssl_get_record_info.
    
    Fixes: v2.3.0rc0-2152-g77404250d5 ("(D)TLS: consolidate and simplify decrypted records handling")

    Remove this check from all mandatory IE macros, and put it at the beginning

    test: add (D)TLS test for AEAD ciphers
    
    TLS and DTLS share the same code for decryption of AEAD ciphers.
    Add tests for all possible AEAD cipher modes (GCM, CCM, CCM_8).
    PSK is used to reduce the handshake size (removing certificates).
    
    The decryption suite passes these tests on:
    
    * Libgcrypt 1.6.5 (Ubuntu 14.04)
    * Libgcrypt 1.7.6 (Arch Linux)
    * Libgcrypt 1.4.5 (CentOS 6). Note that the GnuTLS packages are too old,
      so tests that depend on RSA keys fail here (but the new tests pass).

    (HKDF-Expand-Label, calculation of traffic secrets, AEAD integration).
    Can successfully decrypt the initial handshake message. Only AES ciphers
    are supported, ChaCha20-Poly1305 still needs to be added.
    
    Note: "decryption" indeed works, but dissection needs to be updated. The
    padding must be stripped and the content type extracted.

    ssl-utils: refactor AEAD decryption handling
    
    The current ssl_decrypt_record is hard to understand due to mixing CBC
    concepts (MAC, padding) with AEAD. Extract the AEAD functionality and
    use better variable naming.
    
    The "Plaintext" debug print now includes just the plaintext (the auth
    tag is stripped). A write_iv.data_len check is added just to be sure and
    more prep work is done for auth tag validation and TLS 1.3 support.

    Register all reassembly tables with a central unit, allowing the
    central unit to have the callback that initializes and destroys
    the reassembly tables, rather than have dissectors do it individually.

    (D)TLS: consolidate and simplify decrypted records handling
    
    Previously there was a distinction between decrypted handshake
    Application Data records ("Decrypted SSL data") and some others (like
    Alerts, Handshake and Heartbeat, "Decrypted SSL record"). Remove this
    distinction and always decrypt the payload before passing it on and
    always display a data sources for decrypted contents ("Decrypted SSL").
    
    This is prepatory work for TLS 1.3 support where the content type is
    located in the encrypted record, having the record decryption in one
    place makes it easier to adapt.

    Qt: Preference editor improvements.
    
    Use correct disconnect() signature to ensure everything is disconnected
    before connecting new signals.  Without this all previous connects() are
    still active.  This leads to gradually more and more syntax checks being
    called for each change, and possibility of a wrong syntax check
    (especially for strings which has no syntax check).
    
    Use the textEdited() signal to trigger a syntax check at startup.
    This gives consistency.
    
    Do not clear preferenceLineEdit when done because it looks weird when
    the preference text disappears while the widget is hiding.  The entry
    is cleared before next show anyway.

    Clean up some UN*X-vs-Windows socket issues.
    
    Have a wsutil/socket.h file, for inclusion by everything that uses
    sockets, that contains the UN*X-vs-Windows #includes and #defines to
    hide some UN*X-sockets vs. Winsock API differences.  That stuff mostly
    comes from from extcap/extcap-base.h; have that file just include
    wsutil/socket.h rather than defining that stuff itself.
    
    Include it in sharkd_daemon.c.  Use socklen_t for the size of things to
    pass to bind() as the last argument; wsutil/socket.h defines it as int
    on Windows.
    
    Ignore sharkd in Git.

    DVB-S2-BB: Support all four MA modes
    
    Support all four mode adaptation input and output interfaces defined in
    SatLabs reference document sl_561, "Mode Adaptation Input and Output
    Interfaces for DVB-S2 equipment", instead of only the two modes that use
    a sync byte.
    
    There is nothing in the packet format that specifies which format is in
    use, so we have to guess based on the possible occurrence of a sync byte
    and the CRC-protected BBHEADER that follows the mode adaptation header,
    which is a different length for each format. This is a heuristic dissector,
    so if none of the four formats match, we just return.
    
    Unfortunately, the BBHEADER CRC is only 8 bits, so there can be false
    matches rather often. We detect when the packet matches more than one format,
    and issue an expert info diagnostic. It is also possible for a UDP packet
    that isn't DVB-S2 at all to match spuriously, with probability around 1%
    (assuming random data). This is acceptable for a heuristic dissector,
    especially one that is initially disabled.
    
    Standardize spelling per sl_561: adaption -> adaptation

    Qt: Add Goodput graph (ACK rate), and minor bug fixes
    
    Add Goodput graph:
     - measures rate of ACKed bytes (including SACKed bytes)
     - useful to compare to throughput during slow-start to estimate
         bottleneck rate
    
    Add graph selection checkboxes to multi-plot graphs:
     - most important for Throughput, since there are good cases
         for showing a subset of graphs at once
     - also added for Window Scale, since the addition is similar
         to that for Throughput
    
    Minor bug fixes:
     - allow zoom rect to work when growing in any direction
         (not just right and up)
     - keep stray mouse clicks from re-doing a previous zoom
     - hide rubber band if active when keypress changes mouse mode
         to drag
     - allow mouse clicks on open space or grpah to return to default focus
         (i.e. focus on graph)

    2. Hide the ugliness of the union stuff and make it transparent to the API.

    Don't feed the subtree nodes to the data printer. The data printer can't
    recognize it as such, can't handle it, or worse, could break stuff.

     - change RTT computation to properly handle acks to GSO packets
     - change RTT computation to take SACK blocks into account
    
    Bug fixes:
     - eliminate potential memory leak if some packets are unacked
     - ensure RTT graph is shown if TCPGraph window is opened to it directly

    Interpret packet contents according to the descriptive fields contained
    in the BB header. Instead of always assuming a Generic Stream frame format,
    use the TS/GS field to detect Generic Stream, Generic Packetized, Transport
    Stream, or (reserved) frame formats and decode accordingly.
    
    In the case of Generic Stream frames, check the validity of header fields
    ISSYI, NPD, and UPL, and issue expert info if they are invalid for Generic
    Stream frames. Then dissect as GSE (as before).
    
    For other frame formats, just dump them as bytes for now.

    dns: change get_dns_name to return consumed bytes + actual name len.
    
    Because of the DNS name encoding, the consumed bytes in the tvb and
    the length of the string of the dns name can be different. We need
    to handle them separately for the purpose they are. Moreover the
    name string can contain null bytes, then we can't rely on strlen()
    but we need the actual length.
    
    Subsequent calls to proto_tree_add_string() will require to pass
    the string to format_text() in order have non-printable characters
    printed.

    oesn't work in all cases. I was given sample files that consist of

    Use a new approach to detect a .camins file by searching for pairs of
    size high + size low blocks, either read or write. Go through the
    entire file. If we have significantly more pairs than single, non-matching
    blocks, this is a camins file.

Date:   Mon Jan 9 22:18:49 2017 -0800

    Rename tvb_new_subset() to tvb_new_subset_length_caplen().
    
    This emphasizes that there is no such thing as *the* routine to
    construct a subset tvbuff; you need to choose one of
    tvb_new_subset_remaining() (if you want a new tvbuff that contains
    everything past a certain point in an existing tvbuff),
    tvb_new_subset_length() (if you want a subset that contains everything
    past a certain point, for some number of bytes, in an existing tvbuff),
    and tvb_new_subset_length_caplen() (for all other cases).
    
    Many of the calls to tvb_new_subset_length_caplen() should really be
    calling one of the other routines; that's the next step.  (This also
    makes it easier to find the calls that need fixing.)

Date:   Fri Jan 6 16:23:18 2017 +0000

    Make column size sanity check more sensible.
    
    The existing sanity check on column_size makes incorrect assumptions
    about the size of the CTableColumn structure (which is an internal
    dissector structure that contains optional data). The sanity check
    test *always* fails. This change uses the minimum size of CTableColumn
    structure instead which should prevent excessive allocation during fuzz
    testing.

    Running Wireshark through a symlink doesn't work.
    
    We can't just symbolically link to the executables, as that means that
    the executable won't be in Contents/MacOS, which means that all
    @executable_path-relative references will go to the wrong place if we
    run the executables using the symlink, which means that the executables
    could fail (they *do* fail to find the Cocoa Qt plugin, for example).
    
    So, instead, we go back to the old version of the utility launcher, and
    put that in Contents/Resources/bin as well as, if the user requests the
    CLI utilities, /usr/local/bin.  Maybe PackageMaker will find that
    acceptable and include them in the installer package.

    No reason not to use etype_vals for an Ethertype field.
    
    Maybe there was an issue on Windows back in the old days, when 1) we
    didn't have a shared libwireshark library from which to import functions
    and data variables and thus you couldn't get variables such as
    etype_vals in a plugin and 2) the Infiniband dissector was a plugin, but
    neither of those are the case any more.

    Dissectors don't need a journey of self discovery.
    
    They already know who they are when they register themselves.  Saving the
    handle then to avoid finding it later.
    Not sure if this will increase unnecessary register_dissector functions
    (instead of using create_dissector_handle in proto_reg_handoff function)
    when other dissectors copy/paste, but it should make startup time
    a few microseconds better.

    Revert "Support all MA modes, fix BB CRC and frag edge cases"
    
    Supporting all MA modes this way makes the dissector useless as a heuristic dissector; it always matches. I just didn't understand about heuristic dissectors, and will look for a better solution.
    
    The fragmentation edge cases were also misunderstood. On closer reading of the spec, these are not valid edge cases to be handled smoothly, but packet formatting errors to be diagnosed.
    
    The BB CRC fix is valid AFAIK, and will be resubmitted separately.
    
    This reverts commit 2563503301aa4321a9a7a1ed392c9cbbe147fd2f.

Date:   Sat Dec 17 23:12:11 2016 +0100

    CMake,autotools: enable -Werror=implicit by default
    
    The -Wimplicit error covers two warnings, trying to catch these cases:
    
    Setting a global variable without declaring its type (-Wimplicit-int):
    
        undeclared_type = 1;
    
    More importantly, -Wimplicit-function-declaration catches the case where
    a function is not declared (missing header, programming error, etc.).
    
    Turn these warnings into errors, most likely it will be a programming
    error that results in a link failure anyway. See also
    https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Fedora26CFlags
    
    Also fix autotools checks not to trigger -Wimplicit-int and
    -Wimplicit-function-declaration (in krb5 check due to missing include).
    Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 (autotools & cmake) and Arch Linux (cmake),
    configure/cmake output and config.h are identical.

    Infiniband: Use base of packet tree (top_tree) for "infiniband.mad.cm.private" heuristic dissector.
    
    The "infiniband.payload" heuristic dissector was converted to use the base
    of the packet tree so that subdissectors could show their protocol as the
    base layer.  Since many of the subdissectors use the same dissection function
    for both "infiniband.payload" and "infiniband.mad.cm.private", ensure that
    both use the same "tree level", but still pass in the "payload tree" as part
    of the dissector data in case a subdissector wants to use it (currently used
    by InfinibandSDP)

    Cleanup transum post-dissector.
    
    1. Enable/disable preference not needed - just use Enabled Protocol
    dialog interface.  Added support for backwards compatibility of preference.
    2. Add value_string for calculation values
    3. Create an structured array of "hfs of interest" so they can more easily
    be extended.
    4. Convert a bunch of arrays into hash tables and lists.  For the amount
    of wasted space they were taking up, we can live with the very slight
    performance degrade.  Also puts less limits on number of things to process.

    Support all four mode adaptation interface formats. Add a user preference to
    specify which format is in use, or to request that the format be guessed.
    Guessing is improved, but can never be reliable.
    
    Fix problem with baseband header CRC check that caused almost all packets to
    show a spurious CRC error, introduced with proto_tree_add_checksum.
    
    Fix problem with GSE PDU fragmentation CRC beginning in one fragment and
    ending in another. Any GSE frames following the fragment containing the
    end of the CRC would be parsed at the wrong offset.
    
    Fix problem with IPv4 or IPv6 starting exactly on a fragmentation boundary,
    so that one baseband frame contains the complete GSE header but zero bytes
    of the IP payload. Trying to further dissect the zero-length payload led to
    a "malformed packet" display.

Author: Mikael Kanstrup <mikael.kanstrup@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Mar 19 09:36:57 2016 +0100

    Avoid recursive scan_local_interfaces operation
    
    When the local networks interfaces changes quickly or when refreshing the
    list of network interfaces there's a risk of recursive calls into
    scan_local_interfaces. The recursive calls are a result of calling
    update_cb to process UI events during function operation which in turn
    again discover a network interface change. This results in strange
    duplicate entries of network interfaces and crashes.
    
    To avoid recursive calls a check is added to stop running the function while
    already updating. This patch is really just a workaround for the problem.
    Ideally some asynchronous operation should be implemented instead to avoid
    the UI update_cb callback alltogether.

    Add enabled protocol list for dissectors who are disabled by default
    
    We save a list of dissectors that are disabled through the Enabled Protocols
    dialog.  This is because we assume dissectors are enabled by default.
    
    For dissectors that are disabled by default, we have no way to keep them
    enabled through the Enabled Protocols dialog.  A dissector that defaults
    to being disabled has to be reset to enabled each time Wireshark is launched.
    
    Add a list similar to the disabled list for enabling dissectors that are
    disabled by default.
    This mostly applies to post-dissectors.

    make proto_tree_add_bitmask_value_with_flags() work for tvb==NULL
    
    proto_tree_add_bitmask_value_with_flags() eventually calls
    proto_tree_add_XXX() for the main hf and for the field elements.
    
    These functions work for tvb==NULL if the length is also set to 0.
    Otherwise, we'll end up in proto_tree_add_pi(), get_hfi_length() and
    run into the DISSECTOR_ASSERT() there.
    
    proto_tree_add_bitmask_value...() are meant for cases where the data is
    passed directly and not read from a tvb. If tvb==NULL, set our length to
    0 instead of using the field length from the main hf.

    DVB-CI: don't call proto_tree_add_subtree_format() with tvb==NULL

    for tvb==NULL if len was also 0. The bounds check added in
    56706427f53cc64793870bf072c2c06248ae88f3 breaks this use case and makes
    DVB-CI spill out dissector asserts.
    
    Warn Dissector bug, protocol DVB-CI, in packet 625:
    ../epan/tvbuff.c:532: failed assertion "tvb && tvb->initialized"
    
    Create a proto_item first and link the subtree to this item. This will
    work as long as proto_tree_add_uint() accepts tvb==NULL.

    RPC: fix crash when using "Dissect unknown RPC program numbers" option
    
    When using this option, rpc_prog_info_value structure is not fully initialized.
    Depending on the memory allocator used, this can lead to a NULL pointer
    dereference or an access to a random memory block.
    Ensure that the structure if fully initialized and test pointer before
    dereferencing it.

    packet: duplicate short_name to fix UAF in wslua
    
    The "short_name" parameter of heur_dissector_add is defined as const
    (and was assumed to be a string literal). This was no longer the case
    though since a change in Lua where "short_name" is a dynamically
    allocated string.
    
    This "simple" fix clones the memory for internal use to avoid a
    heap-use-after-free when heur_dissector_delete tries to access
    "short_name".
    
    An alternative option is to make Proto_register_heuristic track the
    memory, but since there are multiple possible heuristics lists for a
    protocol, the Proto (struct _wslua_field_t) structure is not
    appropriate. A possible working alternative is to store the string into
    lua_heur_dissectors_table_ref (replacing the value (function) by a tuple
    {function,short_name}).

    Decode As.  Most subdissectors still kept some basic heuristics in
    their heuristic functions, but now also register with the Infiniband
    dissector table for "manually" forcing dissection with Decode As.

    On macOS, this does not work for Lua since files are installed into
    $BUILDDIR/run/Wireshark.app/Contents/Resources/share/wireshark/init.lua
    instead. Since CMake always copies data files (radius, console.lua,
    etc.) into the build directory, make get_datafile_dir() return this
    "run" directory instead.

    Lua: Add unit names support.
    
    Add support for using unit names in ProtoField integer types by
    using base.UNIT_STRING.
    
    Add unit name table argument in ProtoField.float() and
    ProtoField.double() (and made backward compatibility).
    
    The use of base.UNIT_STRING is not really the best API for adding
    unit names in Lua, but is the simples solution without adding new
    arguments to ProtoField.

commit e6a9877
Author: Nora Sandler <nsandler@securityinnovation.com>
Date:   Thu Dec 8 16:54:37 2016 -0800

    Improved  parsing of sniffed homeplug-av data
    
    This patch modifies the homeplug-av dissector to better decode sniffer data according to the IEEE 1901-2010 standard.
    The dissector now decodes MPDU variant fields correctly based on delimiter type, and decodes beacon MPDU payloads.
    There are some variable-length fields it doesn't handle yet.

    Save RTP audio to file: RTP Stream Analysis dialog allows save audio for non G.711 codecs and mixed codecs
    
    - spaghetti code for save was split into separate functions
    - code saves G.711 only, all other codecs are saved as silence with correct duration
      - code is ready to include other codecs
      - code supports 8000 Hz sampling rate only, other rates are rejected with warning
      - bidirectional stream (forward and reverse) creates stereo .au file
    - output is based on timestamps in RTP streams
      - save operation is slower than before because it is set of seek() - one per each codec sample
    - code allows align of save audio:
      - as it is - each stream is saved from its beginning, no aling
      - to start of each other - later stream is prepended with silence
      - align saved audio to beginning of capture file - each stream is prepended with silence
    - save to raw works correctly now - only payload is saved
      - old code was inserting G.711 silence time to time to raw data

    bthci_acl: Set src/dst addresses before reassembly.
    
    Set all addresses before we do reassembly because sub-dissectors may set
    their own addresses, and we don't want to override them again.
    
    This fixes "Follow TCP Stream" and shows the correct IP addresses in the
    Source and Destination columns when transporting IP packets.
    
    Allocate the addresses in pinfo pool to avoid possible stack buffer overflow.

    packet-infiniband: Update conversation src port for exact lookup
    
    Dissectors above infiniband (such as RPC dissector)
    performs exact lookup on saddr, daddr, sport, dport. They are unaware
    that underlying transport is infiniband which doesn't have src_qp in
    packets. Due to which srcport remains uninitialized and exact lookup
    fails.
    In order to get them work seemlessly, this fix updates the sport
    to src_qp (similar to destport to dest_qp). With this upper level
    dissectors can perform direct lookup similar to TCP. Those which need to
    access private data of unidirectional CM messages, can still continue to
    perform unidirectional lookup as before.
    
    It also fixes the issue where req_qp and resp_qp were swapped during
    bidirectional conversation creation. This was caught during testing with
    packet-rpc.c by Chuck Lever.
    
    Tested protocols:
    1. nfs-rdma over Infiniband with trace of Bug 13213
    2. ICMP packets over Infiniband
    3. NVMe fabrics over RDMA
    Tested with trace of Bug 13201 for Nvme.

    Do not just decode the payload type for RTP/AVP, but also all RTP
    transport types.
    
    Add RTP/AVPF (same as normal RTP/AVP, but with additional RTCP formats).
    Similarly, add RTP/SAVPF and the two DTLS variants. Add references to
    the relevant specifications and order per IANA registry.
    
    Tested with dtls-srtp-ws-sip.pcapng, now the payload types under the
    "m=" tree have names and frames that were previously reported as RTP
    show up as SRTP. Frame 442 now shows "Encrypted RTCP Payload" warning

    packet-rpcrdma: Prepare dissector for RPC-over-RDMA on iWARP or RoCE
    
    Remove the Infiniband-centric QP filtering. This filtering attempted
    to create conversations to allow the heuristic dissector to be
    bypassed once it was established that a QP was carrying
    RPC-over-RDMA traffic.
    
    However, it was preventing proper identification of RPC-over-RDMA
    traffic when a CM connection establishment exchange doesn't appear
    in the capture (which is frequently the case for captures of NFS
    traffic).
    
    Also, without this conversation logic, loading a capture file
    appears to be significantly faster, at least for capture files
    I have on hand.
    
    Later, some form of conversation management will be needed in
    order to associate RPC-over-RDMA transport headers with
    RDMA Read and Write operations that go along with them. But it
    will need to be agnostic about the underlying link layer.

    cops: try to avoid uninitialized warning error
    
    Valgrind 3.11.0 on the Ubuntu 16.04 buildbot reports that
    cops_call->solicited is not initialized:
    
        pdus_array = (GPtrArray *)wmem_map_lookup(cops_conv_info->pdus_tree, GUINT_TO_POINTER(handle_value));

    which is clearly bogus since the only place where cops_call could be
    created is a few lines up:
    
        ver_flags = tvb_get_guint8(tvb, offset);
        is_solicited = (lo_nibble(ver_flags) == 0x01);
        /* ... */
        pdus_array = (GPtrArray *)wmem_map_lookup(cops_conv_info->pdus_tree, GUINT_TO_POINTER(handle_value));

        cops_call = wmem_new(wmem_file_scope(), cops_call_t);
        cops_call->op_code = op_code;
        cops_call->solicited = is_solicited;
        /* ... */
        g_ptr_array_add(pdus_array, cops_call);
    
    Try to zero the whole structure to avoid this bogus warning.

    codecs: Add support for G.722 and G.726
    
    Integrate the Spandsp library for G.722 and G.726 support. Adds support
    for G.722 and all eight variants of G.726.
    
    Note: this also fixes a crash in Qt (buffer overrun, reading too much
    data) caused by confusion of the larger output buffer (resample_buff)
    with the smaller input buffer (decode_buff). It was not triggered before
    because the sample rate was always 8k, but with the addition of the new
    codecs, a different sample rate became possible (16k).
    
    Fix also a crash which occurs when the RTP_STREAM_DEBUG macro is enabled
    and the VOIP Calls dialog is opened (the begin frame, start_fd, is not
    yet known and therfore a NULL dereference could occur).
    
    Passes testing (plays normally without bad RTP timing errors) with
    SampleCaptures files: sip-rtp-g722.pcap and sip-rtp-g726.pcap. Tested
    with cmake (Qt), autotools (Qt and GTK+) with ASAN enabled.

    sdp: refactor session/media level handling of attributes
    
    The media_count meaning is horrendous. -1 means "none", a count of "0"
    actually means "1". This led to various bugs in the past, so just rip it
    out and use a (wmem) array from which the length can be determined.
    
    That also means that a hard-coded limit on the media can now easily be
    lifted without affecting the size of the transport_info_t structure.
    (This limit, SDP_MAX_RTP_CHANNELS,  is unchanged in this patch though.)
    
    Refactor the SDP dissector such that:
    
     - Media and related attributes are no longer a bunch of fixed array
       fields, but grouped in one structure. This results in the largest
       changes all over the place since "transport_info->media[n]" is now
       transformed into "media_desc->media" where "media_desc" is an element
       of the "transport_info->media_descriptions" wmem array.
     - Simplify protocol (in "m=") parsing (lots of ifs -> array + loop).
     - Remove convert_disposable_media and disposable_media_info_t, parse
       fields (media protocol from "m=", connection address from "c=", etc.)
       while parsing the SDP instead of parsing it at the end.
     - Have two distinct structures for keeping the info for the session and
       media level. Emphasize that new media descriptions are inherited from
       session level attributes (via sdp_new_media_description).
     - Delay creation of dynamic payload type information table until we
       actually create the media description. Create function
       clean_unused_media_descriptions to handle the common of freeing
       unused dynamic pt.
     - Remove SDP_IPv4/SDP_IPv6, these are replaced by checking the type
       member of the address structure.
    
    Changes to MSRP part:
    
     - Move MSRP attributes to the media-level attributes.
     - Remove msrp_transport_address_set attribute, rely on the AT_NONE
       address type for detecting bad addresses.
     - Remove SDP_MSRP_IPv4 check, this never worked as the flag was never
       set. Now it relies on the address family from the host in a=path:.
    
    Tested with these capture files with no change in PDML output nor
    improvements/regressions with memleaks (as reported by ASAN):

commit 38f45e1
Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Sat Dec 3 01:20:10 2016 +0100

    SDP: reduce code duplication
    
    Observe that some code in setup_sdp_transport is effectively the same
    code as a part from dissect_sdp with these differences:
    
     - Removal of these two conditions (setup_sdp_transport already returns
       early when a packet is visited):
        (!pinfo->fd->flags.visited) && (transport_info == &local_transport_info)
     - "establish_frame" in setup_sdp_transport is replaced by "pinfo->num"
       in dissect_sdp.
    
    dissect_sdp further has two additional blocks that add information to
    the VoIP calls dialog. This is preserved.
    
    Freeing of the RTP payload information has also been simplified. Instead
    of checking it inside the main loop that adds addresses (now moved to a
    new function, "apply_sdp_transport"), let the caller do it outside the
    loop.
    
    The transformation in this patch is rather mechanical:
    
     0. Add a comment on what the new function is supposed to do.
     1. Move code from setup_sdp_transport into a new function,
        apply_sdp_transport and reduce indentation level.
     2. Copy all variables to the new function and populate the parameter
        list.
     3. Compile result, remove unused variables that the compiler warns for.
     4. Move freeing of unused media outside the loop to the caller.
     5. Create a new conditional statement before the duplicated loop, which
        checks whether setup_sdp_transport has been used before. (SIP first
        calls setup_sdp_transport, then it invokes the media type dissector
        which calls dissect_sdp to populate the tree.)
     6. Remove the duplicated code from the dissect_sdp loop until only the
        VoIP Calls dialog info remains.
    
    There is no functional change intended.

    Clean up initialization code for programs.
    
    Make the init_progfile_dir() call unconditionally, even if plugins
    aren't supported, as that doesn't necessarily mean nobody uses the
    directory containing the executable.
    
    Report the error the same way in all programs, and free the error string
    after we're finished with it.
    
    Make the error - and the comment before the code - reflect what
    init_progfile_dir() is actually doing (the goal is to get the full
    pathname of the directory *containing* the executable; that's generally
    done by getting the pathname of the executable and stripping off the
    name of the executable, but that's won't necessarily always be the
    case).  Also note for TShark that we won't be able to capture traffic,
    just as we do for Wireshark (if we don't have the pathname of the
    program file, we don't have a pathname to use to find dumpcap).
    
    Have the plugin scanner just fail silently if we weren't able to get the
    plugin directory path, so we don't have to worry about calling it if
    init_progfile_dir() fails.
    
    Clean up white space while we're at it.

    Have a routine to do all the work of initializing libwiretap.
    
    Have programs that use libwiretap call that routine rather than
    separately calling some or all of init_open_routines(),
    wtap_register_plugin_types(), and wtap_opttypes_initialize().
    
    Also don't have routines internal to libwiretap call those.  Yes, this
    means doing some initialization work when it isn't necessary, but

    packet-infiniband: Fixed duplicate conversation entries
    
    1. Fixed find_conversation for PT_IBQP to not lookup in reverse
    direction when all searches fail.
    This is required, because there could be valid different connection in
    reverse direction which mistakenly gets updated for non template cases.
    
    2. Added support for having MAD data for upper level dissectors to process
    during RC packet processing.
    This is required because connection options are negotiated out of band
    using this CM exchanges (unlike in band TCP options).
    
    3. Moved creating unidirectional connections when actually MAD packets
    are processed.
    Previously client-to-server unidirectional conversation was created when
    CM_RSP stage, where MAD Data of CM_REQ packet is inaccessible.
    
    4. Fixed creating multiple conversations with same address property by
    eliminating create_conv_and_add_proto_data during RTU stage, which was
    incorrect.
    Now they are created during REQ and RSP frame processing. (Instead of
    RSP and RTU processing).
    
    5. Added support for creating bidirectional connection that ULP can
    refer.
    This is required to keep track of oustanding transactions on a
    connection (requests and responses).

commit 6e02789
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Fri Dec 2 01:29:26 2016 -0800

    Do *NOT* strip newlines from the standard input of sed.
    
    There is *NO* guarantee that sed will do anything useful with input that
    doesn't have a newline and, in fact, the default sed in Solaris 11
    doesn't produce *any* output if you hand it input with no newline.
    
    Furthermore, doing xxx=`yyy` will, if the output of yyy has newlines at
    the end, strip them; to quote section 2.6.3 "Command Substitution" of
    the Single UNIX Specification:
    
            The shell shall expand the command substitution by executing
            command in a subshell environment (see Shell Execution
            Environment) and replacing the command substitution (the text of
            command plus the enclosing "$()" or backquotes) with the
            standard output of the command, removing sequences of one or
            more <newline> characters at the end of the substitution.
    
    so there's no need to strip the newline.

    Qt: Fix QStyledItemDelegate assertions.
    
    QStyledItemDelegate::paint asserts if you pass it an empty QModelIndex.
    We were doing this in PercentBarDelegate and TimelineDelegate in order to
    keep it from drawing any text. Return an empty string from ::displayText
    instead, which appears to be the correct way to paint without text.

    Qt: fix crash when closing RTP player while playing
    
    For some time, the RTP Player has been crashing for me (Arch Linux, Qt
    5.7.0) when the RTP Player is active (affects also Wireshark 2.0.5).
    
    This call trace was observed:
    
        + RtpPlayerDialog::reject (closing dialog via Escape / Close button)
          + RtpAudioStream::stopPlaying
            + RtpAudioStream::outputStateChanged(QAudio::StoppedState)
              + QAudioOutput::deleteLater   // problematic!
          + RtpPlayerDialog::~RtpPlayerDialog
            + RtpAudioStream::~RtpAudioStream
    
    As the QAudioOutput instance is a child of RtpAudioStream, it is also
    destroyed after that. QAudioOutput's destructor somehow invokes (via
    libqtmedia_pulse.so) a main loop iteration which invokes the previously
    scheduled deleteLater call.
    
    As QAudioOutput was already being destructed, this results in a crash.
    Workaround this by removing this child from RtpAudioStream (no cruelty
    intended).

    packet-dcm.c: Cleanup memory usage with strings
    
    wmem_file_scope() was used too many times when wmem_packet_scope() will do.
    Also, use the wmem string functions to only allocate enough space to
    handle a string instead of using MAX_BUF_LEN.

    Add .gitlab-ci.yml.
    
    As for .travis.yml, this file triggers the CI module of GITLAB.
    On the public instance of gitlab (gitlab.com) the runners are active
    by default, then any mirror of wireshark on gitlab.com will result
    in an automated build.
    
    The current version of .gitlab-ci.yml builds with gcc 4,5,6 and with
    default config, without extcap and without pcap.

    Fix -1 lengths in proto_tree_add_item_ret_string_and_length().
    
    Currently, when passing a -1 length to proto_tree_add_item_ret_string_and_length() or
    proto_tree_add_item_ret_string(), the -1 length will be passed directly
    to the field info. The calculated length should be used instead.

    tcp: fix "calculated checksum" tree item for bad checksums
    
    The Calculated Checksum tree item prints the checksum from the
    tvb, instead of the computed one  (the "should be 0x...." tree
    item above it _does_ print the computed one).  As such, in a packet
    with bad checksum, the Calculated Checksum is incorrect.  Fix the value.
    
    This seems to have been introduced in ad6fc87d ("Add

    Have separate flags to indicate whether we *have* an IE specifying an
    FT AKM suite and whether we *have* an IE specifying a non-FT AKM suite.
    Use those to decide whether to add an expert info, so we add it
    regardless of whether we are building a protocol tree or not.
    
    Set the protocol tree item for the first FT AKM suite and the first
    non-FT AKM suite only if we have a protocol tree.

    CIP: Properly handle EPATH attributes that do not specify path size
    
    Most attributes specify the path length before the EPATH data, but some do not. The previous code for parsing EPATHs just looped until there was no more data. This is a problem for EPATH that do not specify a length, because it will eat up too many bytes. This mainly affects Get Attribute List Responses and Set Attribute List Requests. For the small number of attributes like this, the Spec says exactly what kind of segment should be in the EPATH, so just parse a single segment.
    
    This fixes: Port attributes: 'Port Number and Node Address' and 'Chassis Identity'
    There is still one that is a problem in packet-cipsafety.c, but we will have to deal with it later. See the TODO in that file.
    
    I use the .pcap attached to https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12049, to make sure I didn't break any existing path/segment handling.

    lua: Allow proto:register_heuristic to be used on multiple list names
    
    In the C API, one can register a heuristic for the same protocol on different
    lists by specifying another unique short_name. This is impossible in the
    lua API, as the protocol name is used as the short name itself.
    
    This change fixes that by creating an unique shortname composed of the
    protocol name and the target list name.

    applied.
    
    For the Capture Options dialog however, the appInitialized signal is
    never triggered since the GUI has already started. Just invoke it from
    the constructor such the menu is populated at least once.

    gsm_abis_om2000: Expand bit-width of CON CCP and CI fields
    
    It seems more recent RBS2000 models have extended the range of the CON
    Connection Point (CCP) by one bit, as I'm seeing CCP 1896 in protocol
    traces.  Similarly, the Contiguity Index can at least reach 96.  Using
    the full 8bit value to make sure IS and CON dissectors use the same
    ranges for connection points and contiguity index.

    cmake: fix the linker flags test for Visual Studio
    
    ddd1c87d43781533c3ec10279857e3870d12437e modified the order
    of linker command line options. This broke the tests and made
    invalid linker flags seem valid.
    
    (Link target) ->
      LINK : warning LNK4044: unrecognized option '/Wl,--as-needed'; ignored [C:\wireshark\build3\wsutil\wsutil.vcxproj]
      LINK : warning LNK4044: unrecognized option '/pie'; ignored [C:\wireshark\build3\wsutil\wsutil.vcxproj]
    
    The simple fix is to add specific options for Visual Studio and clang at the beginning of
    the linker's command line options rather than at the end.

    ERF: Fix issues with Host ID mapping
    
    packet-erf: Fix Host ID/Source ID showing for all extension header types.
    Only show generated Host ID/Source ID when there is a Host ID extension header
    or there was not one on the record.
    Assumes there is only one Source ID if multiple Flow ID extension headers (unlikely)
    and that it matches the one in the Host ID header. This is consistent with other tools.
    Does support multiple Host ID extension headers though.
    
    Fix dag_version tag short name. Was clashing with another tag due to typo.
    
    ERF wiretap: Don't conflate Host ID 0 with implicit Host ID.
    
    While the implicit Host ID defaults to 0, it is not the same thing as seeing
    a packet with Host ID explicitly 0 in the extension header which means
    explicitly unknown source.
    Store the initial (unknown) implicit Host ID interface mapping in it's own
    special mapping table entry rather than 0.
    
    Noticed we can currently get duplicate interfaces in the unusual event of mixed
    implicit and explicit Host ID packet extension headers for the same ID before
    we discover that mapping.
    Consistently abandon the implicit version for consistency with the dissector
    linking behaviour and mark the interface as unmatched in the description. In
    2 pass mode (including normal Wireshark file open) the abandoned interface ends
    up with no packets. In the common cases (all Host ID or no Host ID on packet
    records) this duplicate interface will not be created in the first place.

    cmake: avoid leading space in linker options
    
    This causes problems with cmake 2.8.9, which ships with Debian Wheezy.
    
    Reorder the linker options to avoid a leading space. According to GNU
    ld's manual, the order of linker options on the command line does not
    matter. This should be the same for Visual Studio's cl.exe and for
    clang's linker.
    
    See
    https://www.wireshark.org/lists/wireshark-dev/201604/msg00141.html
    for more details about the problem.

    Rather than displaying the P-GSL data as "data", let's call the

    As the RLC/MAC payload of P-GSL is one un-aligned stream of bits
    containing the EGPRS header + RLC data blocks, we need to re-aling the
    data blocks before calling into the RLC/MAC dissector in case of EGRPS.

    autotools: propagate git version info to distribution tarball
    
    Store the git describe output in the distribution tarball (make dist)
    and ensure that this version is always used for builds from this
    tarball. This will prevent the useless "Git Rev Unknown from unknown"
    output in tar-based builds.
    
    It will also prevent git from being invoked in tarball builds.
    
    Remove the git branch name since the commit ID (and git tag) in the git
    describe output is sufficient to identify the source tree. (In SVN, a
    revision ID had to be paired with a branch name to identify the source
    tree, in git this is no longer the case.)

    Fragmentation reassembly as in PPP MP (RFC 1990/2686)
    
    Add support for defragmentation of fragments that use the defragmentation
    scheme of PPP MP (RFC 1990). Instead of getting "sequence_number,
    fragment_number, last" as in other protocols, PPP MP provides a single
    sequence number that is effectively "seqnum + fragnum", though it provides
    flags for both the first and last fragment of a reassembly.
    
    See Appendix A of RFC 4623 (PWE3 Fragmentation and Reassembly) for a list
    of protocols that use this style, including PPP MP (RFC 1990), PWE3 MPLS
    (RFC 4385), L2TPv2 (RFC 2661), L2TPv3 (RFC 3931), ATM, and Frame Relay.
    
    Also add support for the Multi-class Extension to Multilink PPP (RFC 2686),
    which uses some of the previously reserved bits as classes that distinguish
    otherwise identical sequence numbers.

    Th link throughput and latency objects are just 32-bit integers; process

    respectively, show them as decimal, rather than as hex, as most of us
    have 10, not 16, fingers.
    
    The ETX metric object is a 16-bit integer; process it as such, and show
    it in decimal as well.
    
    Attach an expert info representing an error to the item in error.

Date:   Sun Oct 30 04:20:48 2016 -0400

    packet-infiniband: Fixed IP based connections & other minor fixes
    
    1. Fixed setting right address type instead of AT_IB for RoCE and RRoCE
    depending on address type given by pinfo where address type would be
    IPv4 or IPV6.
    Fail to do so was resulting into infiniband dissector adding
    conversation info based on AT_IB type vs payload dissectors dissecting
    based on pinfo. Fixing this allows to add/search based on right
    address type.
    (Tested for Infiniband and RRoCE)
    
    2. Added support to pass already parsed CM attribute id from infiniand to
    other mad private data dissectors so that right dissection of private data
    can be done based on CM attribute id (message type).
    Moved CM attribute id definitions to header file so that private data
    dissectors based on CM attribute id can reuse these values without
    duplicate defines.
    (Tested for Infiniband and RRoCE)
    
    3. Added direction client to server/server to client, (active/passive) to
    conversation_data for payload dissectors which cannot dissect only based
    on payload content without knowing the direction.
    (Tested for RRoCE)
    
    4. Fixed IP CM to claim all 92 bytes of private data (including consumer
    private data), instead of just 36 bytes of header because its part of IP
    CM private data.
    (Tested for Infiniband and RRoCE)
    
    5. Fixed MAD header to claim all 232 (256-24) bytes of data as it belongs
    to it in the tree.
    (Tested for Infiniband and RRoCE)
    
    6. Fixed getting ip version by performing AND operation first to extract IP
    version field.
    (Tested for RRoCE-IPV4 and Infiniband)

    POP: replace wmem_strndup by tvb_memcpy
    
    gdd3b977 introduced the use of wmem_strndup to ensure that the string is
    NULL terminated.
    But it also stops as soon as it finds a NULL character, which can happen
    with malformed packets. So let's copy all the bytes with tvb_memcpy and
    add manually a NULL character at the end of the buffer for safeness.

    Fix to correctly read unquoted parameter values in Authorization lines.
    Code in master branch will look for double quotes as the end of a
    parameter value even in case the value is not enclosed in double quotes.
    This fix checks if the first character in a value is a double quote in
    which case it will scan until a non-escaped finishing double quote is
    found to determine the end of the value string. If no double quote is
    found as the start of the parameter value it will scan for a comma as
    the end of the value string.

    checkAPI: move atoi from soft-deprecated to prohibited.
    
    The atoi function has been completely removed from the tree.
    It's still present in the GTK code, but, since GTK compilation
    has been removed in the default, checkAPI target doesn't complain,
    as well as the buildbot.

    L2TP: Dissect three formerly unknown bytes in Ericsson Transport Cfg
    
    The meaning of the last three bytes of a Transport configuration has
    been uncovered: They control the batching/bundling of signalling
    messages: All signalling messages are delayed + bundled until either
    the timeout expires, or the message exceeds the limit.

Author: Parav Pandit <paravpandit@yahoo.com>
Date:   Wed Oct 26 03:11:04 2016 -0400

    packet-infiniband: Add support to sub dissect CM messages private data
    
    1. This patch enables sub dissectors to parse RTU, REJ,
    DREQ, DRSP CM messages private data.
    (Sub dissection for CM REQ and RSP private data was
    already present).
    
    2. For dissecting non CM data specific packets, connection
    context needs to be active until connection is closed. So instead of
    removing hash table entry during CM response message,
    it keeps it around until DRSP (when connection is closed).
    
    3. This patch moves CM messsage dissection to their individual
    functions for cleanup, so that main parser remains readable code.
    
    4. created smaller functions for reusing in different message parsing
    functions.
    
    REQ, RSP, DREQ, DRSP message are tested.
    REJ is untested.

    Overhaul AMQP dissector
    
    1. Remove AMQP_INCREMENT macro.  Bounds checking mostly handled already
    by proto_tree_add_xxx and tvb_get_xxx.  Needed to add a few more
    tvb_reported_length_remaining() calls for completeness.
    2. Fill in some of the gaps of unaccounted for bytes.  Still have way
    too many instances where bytes aren't claimed by a field.
    3. Some small reordering of functions allowed for massive removal of
    formal declarations.
    4. Add amqp_0_10_get_32bit_size_new to add a field, check for size and

    5. Remove "hf_" from list type items as they are not real hf_ fields
    and could cause confusion.  Also made items static.
    6. Convert some FT_STRING and FT_BYTES fields to FT_UINT_STRING and
    FT_UINT_BYTES.  Helps account for some "missing" bytes.

    release 1.3.1 in CM Req msg.

    3. Minor code refactor to move to smaller functions for CM Req Rsp
    parsing instead of 200+ lines function which is hard to read and
    is expected to grow for more features
    4. Cleanup around primary and alternate fields which were crossing byte
    boundary
    
    CM request and response messages are tested.
    Reject message reserved fields change is untested but it a minor change
    that is expected to work.

    On UN*X, st_ctime is the last status change time, not the creation time.
    
    That's the time the file's inode last changed, so size changes,
    permission changes, etc. affect it.  It's *not* the time the file was
    created; most UN*Xes don't provide that.  Newer versions of FreeBSD,
    NetBSD, OpenBSD, and macOS do, but other UN*Xes don't appear to.
    
    On Windows, at least according to Microsoft's documentation, st_ctime
    *is* the creation time.  Hopefully that's not the result of confusion on
    the part of somebody at Microsoft.

    Clean up file handle management.
    
    The main reason fclose() could fail is if the file is open for writing,
    not all the buffered data has been written out at the time fclose() was
    called, and the attempt to write it out fails.  In any case, the file
    handle is no longer valid after fclose() completes, whether the close
    succeeds or not, so there's no reason to keep it around.
    
    There's no reason to check whether it's null in a loop called in code
    where it's not null to start with and where it's not set to null in the
    loop.
    
    This should fix CID 1374111.

    debian: Ship ciscodump and sshdump
    
    Both binaries use libssh. Libssh can be linked to OpenSSL or to
    Libgcrypt. Since the ciscodump and sshdump executables are
    covered by GPL-2+ the Debian package build depends on the libssh
    flavor built with libgcrypt.

    wslua: prepare for split class/instance (meta)methods
    
    Previously the metatables for classes were the same for the class and
    its instances. This results in issues like calling __gc on the class
    table on exit.
    
    Make it possible to declare separate class methods (functions) and
    instance methods. Observe that all attributes apply to the instances
    only, so make these just available on the instance.
    
    The attribute/methods lookup method (via __index/__newindex) have been
    rewritten to use upvalues, removing the technical need for the
    properties __getters/__setters/__methods. The "lua globals" test still
    checks for these, but it could be removed in the future.
    
    To fix bug 12968, the __gc method is removed from the class method.
    Future patches should remove the WSLUA_REGISTER_CLASS,
    WSLUA_REGISTER_META and WSLUA_REGISTER_ATTRIBUTES macros completely and
    create split class functions/methods (such that __call for an instance
    cannot accidentally be invoked on the class).
    
    Removed duplicate "fragmented" property from Pinfo (which triggered an
    error) and replaced exit() by g_error() for debugger friendliness.
    Remove lua_shiftstring since checkstring always returns non-NULL.

    debian: Stop using hardening-check during .deb package build
    
    Hardening-check script has been removed from Debian unstable. Checking
    binaries' security features is implemented in Lintian instead which
    will raise proper warnings for not Position Independent Executables
    and binaries missing "bindnow" linker flag.
    
    This also fixes the Lintian error complaining about dependency on
    obsolete hardening-includes package.

    cmake: fix missing docbook dependency
    
    Running "ninja developer_guide_html" somehow did not produce a new HTML
    docbook once wsluarm.ascii (a dependency of developer-guide.xml) was
    modified.
    
    It turns out that output file docbook/wsdg_html/index.html only had a
    ordering-only dependency on target generate_developer-guide.xml. An
    extra dependency is needed on the output file to ensure that the HTML
    file gets rebuild on changes.

    Lua: allow creating TVBs after calling other (Lua) dissectors.
    
    Don't set `lua_tvb` (or any of the other global variables) to NULL after a
    Lua dissector is called: it's possible that the caller is also a Lua dissector
    which may want/need that (global) variable to still be set (to the value it
    had before the sub-dissector was called).
    
    This fixes the problem reported in:
    https://ask.wireshark.org/questions/56110/lua-error-tvbs-can-only-be-created-and-used-in-dissectors
    
    Making these variables not be a globals (as suggested at the top of
    init_wslua.c) might be a better solution--for another day.

    raknet, mcpe: Improve dissectors
    
    packet-raknet.c now correctly dissects the following offline messages:
    * ID_UNCONNECTED_PING
    * ID_UNCONNECTED_PING_OPEN_CONNECTIONS
    * ID_OPEN_CONNECTION_REQUEST_1
    * ID_OPEN_CONNECTION_REPLY_1
    * ID_OPEN_CONNECTION_REQUEST_2
    * ID_OPEN_CONNECTION_REPLY_2
    * ID_OUT_OF_BAND_INTERNAL
    * ID_CONNECTION_ATTEMPT_FAILED
    * ID_ALREADY_CONNECTED
    * ID_NO_FREE_INCOMING_CONNECTIONS
    * ID_CONNECTION_BANNED
    * ID_INCOMPATIBLE_PROTOCOL_VERSION
    * ID_IP_RECENTLY_CONNECTED
    * ID_UNCONNECTED_PONG
    
    packet-raknet.c now correctly dissects the following system messages:
    * ID_CONNECTED_PING
    * ID_CONNECTED_PONG
    * ID_CONNECTION_REQUEST
    * ID_CONNECTION_REQUEST_ACCEPTED
    * ID_NEW_INCOMING_CONNECTION
    
    packet-raknet.h exports the following functions:
    * raknet_add_udp_dissector()
    * raknet_delete_udp_dissector()
    * raknet_conversation_set_dissector()
    
    packet-raknet.c now dissects message flags, reliability, reliable message number and so on. It now reassembles fragmented packets, supports heuristics, supports dissecting combined packets, and gives up dissecting messages when they are encrypted.
    
    packet-raknet.c now calls subdissectors with a tvbuff buffer only having a message ID and payload. It first tries to locate a subdissector based on the port, and then tries heuristic dissectors if any.
    
    packet-mcpe.c is updated so that it uses the new raknet interface, and it now correctly dissects the following game packets:
    * 0x01 Login
    * 0x03 Server to Client Handshake
    * 0x06 Batch
    
    packet-mcpe.c now supports heuristics, and gives up dissecting packets in a conversation once it sees a "Server to Client Handshake" packet because everything, including packet ID, are encrypted after that.

Date:   Tue Oct 4 01:47:26 2016 +0200

    Qt: convert UatDialog to model/view pattern, improve UX
    
    Fixes:
     - Fix crash (heap-use-after-free) on removing a record while editing.
     - Mark a record as invalid if any of the fields fail the validation.
       (Fixes crash in at least the ISAKMP dissector.)
     - Prevent saving of invalid UAT entries (e.g. empty UATs).
     - Do not close the dialog on pressing Enter/Escape while editing,
       close the editor instead.
     - Fix HTML injection in the error messages.
    
    Improvements:
     - Tab-navigation now works between fields.
     - The field editor is now closed once the focus is lost.
     - Fields that fail validation are marked (currently with a pink color).
     - The error hint selection has become smarter (see comments in
       UatDialog::checkForErrorHint).
     - Properly recognizes PT_TXTMOD_HEXBYTES formats like "aa:bb"
       (previously it would not expect the ":" and report a bad length).
       A validator prevents invalid strings from being entered.
     - The OK button is disabled when new/edited records are bad. Notably,
       existing (possibly invalid) records are skipped. (Bug 7471).
    
    Live validation (while typing in the editor) was dropped during
    conversion, but it can be added later if desired.
    
    Drag and drop reordering still needs to be implemented.

    CIP: Attribute updates
    
    1. Combine various Attribute ID filters into a single one "cip.attribute", so that it's easier to find a certain attribute in any part of the packet. This makes sense because Attributes refer to the same property, but various types of messages can have that field in different locations. This applies to Get/Set Attribute Single, Get/Set Attribute List, Get Attributes All.
    2. Connection Manager: Dissect more attributes
    3. Port: Display the Port Type name
    4. Get/Set Attribute Single: Show unparsed data as raw bytes. Previously, if there were extra bytes they were not displayed.
    5. Get/Set Attribute List: Show remaining data for unknown attributes under the main Attribute List tree, instead of under the unknown Attribute ID tree.
    6. Display Attribute ID as DEC, since the specification tables are in decimal.
    7. Update Class list
    8. Minor: Remove some unused variables, typos

    Combine Decode As and port preferences for tcp.port dissector table.
    
    This patch introduces new APIs to allow dissectors to have a preference for
    a (TCP) port, but the underlying data is actually part of Decode As functionality.
    For now the APIs are intentionally separate from the regular APIs that register a
    dissector within a dissector table.  It may be possible to eventually combine the
    two so that all dissectors that register with a dissector table have an opportunity
    to "automatically" have a preference to adjust the "table value" through the
    preferences dialog.
    
    The tcp.port dissector table was used as the guinea pig.  This will eventually be
    expanded to other dissector tables as well (most notably UDP ports).  Some
    dissectors that "shared" a TCP/UDP port preference were also converted. It also
    removed the need for some preference callback functions (mostly when the callback
    function was the proto_reg_handoff function) so there is cleanup around that.
    
    Dissectors that has a port preference whose default was 0 were switched to using
    the dissector_add_for_decode_as_with_preference API rather than dissector_add_uint_with_preference
    
    Also added comments for TCP ports used that aren't IANA registered.

    CIP: More minor bug fixes
    
    1. CIP Safety: Exception Detail Alarm and Exception Detail Warning both were not parsing their 3 parts because the offset was not increased. Fixed the offsets and combined the functions because they have the same format.
    2. CIP: Forward Open Safety Response had wrong offsets so it was parsing incorrectly. This incorrectly showed as Malformed.
    3. CIP Safety: Pass in tvb to proto_tree_add_subtree() instead of NULL. This was causing a Dissector bug (seems only on trunk, not 2.2). This was already done for packet-cip.c under https://code.wireshark.org/review/#/c/16748/
    4. Some minor typos

    Be more forgiving about invalid Coloring Rules.
    
    In ColoringRulesDialog:
    
    Only check a rule's display filter if that rule is enabled. This keeps
    us from disabling the OK button when we shouldn't.
    
    Adjust the "Your coloring rules file contains unknown rules" dialog text
    and buttons for accuracy.
    
    In color_filters.c:
    
    Don't try to compile disabled filters in color_filters_apply. Don't warn
    about disabled and invalid filters in read_filters_file.

    Interface List: Allow column filtering in model
    
    This change allows for the definition of columns to be shown
    to the enduser if instanting the proxy model. The tree model
    will allways transport ALL data, and it is the job of the proxy
    model to determine which data is actually shown.
    
    Additionally, this removes the final definitions of the global
    interface array from interface_frame as well as sort_filter, so
    that knowledge about the inner workings of the interface list
    is contained to interface_tree_model

    wslua: fix wslua file test failure
    
    Lua 5.2.4 built with -DLUA_USE_APICHECK detected a stack issue:
    
        tshark: lapi.c:175: lua_settop: Assertion `(-(idx+1) <= (L->top - (func + 1))) && "invalid new top"' failed.
    
    Function File_read always assumes that File_read_line pushes a value on
    the stack (which clearly did not happen). On read failure, it would then
    pop the stack (tripping the assertion) to push nil.
    
    The other user (File_lines) is also affected by this change, but the Lua
    5.2.4 documentation says that it should also return nil on EOF, fitting
    this implementation.

    Interface List: Change display to view/model
    
    This changes the underlying model of the main interface tree.
    Because of that, we can resort to a view/model approach, enlisting
    the global interfaces list as only data source.
    
    The interface list works identical to the old list, but allows
    for filtering of the displayed interfaces by type. Only types, which
    are present and whose interfaces are not hidden, are being displayed
    for selection.

    This avoids the need to check for WERROR_COMMON_FLAGS before using it.
    
    The transformation is the same for all files, remove
    "if (WERROR_COMMON_FLAGS)" and "endif()", reindent and add quotes (since
    we have a string here and not a list).
    
    Modelines have been added where missing.

    work better when reading from a pipe.

    Use wtap_read_bytes() to skip over bytes when reading a record.
    
    Allow file_read() to take a null pointer as a buffer argument; a null
    argument means "do everything except copy the bytes from the file to the
    user buffer".  That means that wtap_read_bytes() and
    wtap_read_bytes_or_eof() also support a null pointer as a buffer
    argument.
    
    Use wtap_read_bytes() with a null buffer argument rather than
    file_skip() to skip forward over data.
    
    This fixes some places where files were mis-identified as ERF files, as
    the ERF open heuristics now get a short "read" error if they try to skip
    over more bytes than exist in the file.

    ssl: fix crash when setting RSA key file without valid protocol
    
    If ssl_association_add is passed a NULL app_handle argument, it will
    trigger DISSECTOR_ASSERT which fails due to the bad wmem scope
    (wmem_packet_scope). Arguably DISSECTOR_ASSERT should not be used there,
    but its alternative is g_warning/g_assert are not much different...
    
    Fix the crash (assertion failure) by checking that the UAT-supplied
    protocol is really valid. Normally the post_update_cb should not be
    invoked if any of the fields are invalid, but that requires larger
    changes in the Qt UAT dialog code.

    Reorganize the source lists.
    
    For the different classes of generated dissectors, have
    CLEAN_xxx_DISSECTOR_SRC with the ones that compile without warnings,
    DIRTY_xxx_DISSECTOR_SRC for the ones that get warnings, and
    xxx_DISSECTOR_SRC which is the combination of the two.
    
    Add a new NCP2222_DISSECTOR_SRC for the packet-ncp2222.c dissector
    generated by tools/ncp2222.py.  Add a new source group for it.
    
    Move register.c to DISSECTOR_SUPPORT_SRC.  Get rid of
    DISSECTOR_GENERATED_FILES; it's kind of a "none of the above" category,
    and we now have an "above" for all files.
    
    Include NCP2222_DISSECTOR_SRC in DISSECTOR_FILES.
    
    Add an ALL_DISSECTOR_SRC that includes DISSECTOR_FILES and
    CORBA_IDL_DISSECTOR_SRC (why are those kept separate?).  Use it for the
    list of files we use to generate register.c.
    
    Add NCP2222_DISSECTOR_SRC to CLEAN_FILES.
    
    (Hopefully this makes it less likely that we'll forget to use -Werror
    for clean dissector files or forget to use them to generate register.c.)

    printed.

Date:   Sun Sep 18 16:19:58 2016 +0200

    mate: fix Match edge cases, improve documentation
    
    Use strcmp to sort AVPs in an AVPL and for matching instead of comparing
    pointer addresses. Pointers can only be used for (in)equality, there is
    no ordering in them. Matching of attributes however requires a better
    ordering to know whether the operator (condition) or whether the operand
    (data) can be skipped. Otherwise it is possible that condition (b)
    randomly fails to match data (a,b).
    
    User-visible changes (mainly edge cases):
    
     - Loose (a=1, a?) on data (a=0, a=1) would previously fail to return
       (a=0,a=1) because the a? condition is not tried for data a=0. Now it
       tries all compatible conditions for a data AVP.
     - Any Match condition like (a=1, a^1) would previously be treated the
       same as (a=1) while (a^1, a=1) would still be seen as (a^1, a=1). The
       first case is now fixed to match (a=1, a^1). (Via a fix in insert_avp
       to ensure that (a=1) is not considered the same as (a^1).)
     - Every (a=1, a=2) on data (a=1, b=1) previously failed, but the
       comment "it will not create a list if there is not a match for every
       attribute in op" suggests that it should return (a=1).
     - Every (a=1) on data (a=2) previously succeeded (bug) while it would
       fail on (a=2, b=1). This is fixed now by checking whether any of the
       conditions really have matching data for the attribute.
    
    Other changes: optimize merge_avpl and new_avpl_*_match to insert in
    linear time instead of quadratic, rewrite and add comments in an attempt
    to make it easier to understand. Merge the new_avpl_every_match and
    new_avpl_exact_match functions and rename it to new_avpl_pairs_match to
    reflects its actual implemented functionality.
    
    Not addressed in this patch is the quasi-randomness of the returned
    data AVPL. AVPLs are unordered, so the condition Strict (a?) on data
    (a=1, a=2) could in theory return either (a=1) or (a=2). In practice
    this returns (a=1) because of alphabetical ordering, but this cannot
    really be relied on. It gets worse for conditions like Strict (a?, a>1),
    these are considered undefined behavior (without warnings for now).

Date:   Sun Sep 18 18:48:50 2016 -0700

    Improve support for single-character fields and filter expressions.
    
    Add an FT_CHAR type, which is like FT_UINT8 except that the value is
    displayed as a C-style character constant.
    
    Allow use of C-style character constants in filter expressions; they can
    be used in comparisons with all integral types, and in "contains"
    operators.
    
    Use that type for some fields that appear (based on the way they're
    displayed, or on the use of C-style character constants in their
    value_string tables) to be 1-byte characters rather than 8-bit numbers.

    extcap: fix management of multicheck and saved non boolean arguments
    
    Launching USBPcap without going in the interface options menu exhibits 2 bugs:
    - we should restore a value only if it is not an empty string (otherwise USBPcap with an ampty --devices multicheck argument)
    - when building the argument list for a non boolean argument not using the default value, do not call g_strconcat. It will
    build a string concatenating the option and value (for example "--devices 1" that will be treated as a single argument).
    Instead option and value must be given separately to argument list.

    Fix handling of EAP identity.
    
    There's no guarantee that the identity is a string whose first character
    is a prefix indicating the type of identity; only display it as a prefix
    if it's one of the known types.  We really may need some other mechanism
    to determine how to parse the identity, perhaps based on what the
    protocol layers below it are.
    
    Put back the display of the full string in one case where that was
    inadvertently removed.

    eap: make eap_identity_prefix a numeric item
    
    This used to be string item, its value was not 0-terminated. This
    resulted in out-of-bounds mem acceess when eap_identity_prefix was used

    Have TPKT support a TCP port range preference instead of having "subdissectors?" register their own.
    
    There are a number of dissectors who are subdissectors of TPKT (and OSITP) that are
    not called by TCP dissector directly, yet can possibly register a TCP port "on the
    behalf" of TPKT.  Just allow TPKT to support a range of ports to possibly include
    these protocols.
    Remove the preferences from these dissectors, but add backwards compatibility for
    the preferences by hooking into set_prefs and have the preferences just hook into
    Decode As functionality directly.

    ZigBee: Fix reassembly of APS fragments.
    
    The unsigned variable num_blocks was initialized to -1. Which caused the
    dissector to set the total length to 4294967295 fragments when the second
    fragment was processed. This made the dissector unable to reassemble data
    made of more than two fragments.

    ssl-utils: remove block and key sizes from cipher suites table
    
    There was an implicit dependency between the block size in the cipher
    suites table and the size expected by Libgcrypt. Just remove the block
    size from the table and rely on the value from Libgcrypt to avoid the
    risk of mismatching values (which could lead to a buffer overflow).
    
    While at it, remove the size of the key ("bits") and the size of key
    material ("eff_bits") too. Move the key material sizes for export
    ciphers away from the table and use byte quantities instead of bits.
    
    Additionally, this fixes an issue where 8 bytes of uninitialized stack
    memory is written to the SSL debug log for stream ciphers like RC4.
    The size of the Write Key is also corrected for export ciphers, now it
    prints the actual (restricted) number of bytes that are used.

    ssl-utils: fix buffer overrun (read) with AEAD cipher suites
    
    ssl_cipher_init should only set the IV for CBC cipher suites. NULL
    cipher suites will not invoke gcry_cipher_setiv and AEAD ciphers will
    set the nonce in a different place anyway.
    
    Fixes a buffer overrun (read) by 12 bytes for any AES-CCM and AES-GCM
    cipher suite because the "block size" is set to 4 bytes while the
    reported block size for AES is 16 bytes (128 bit). (The four bytes are
    the "salt" part of the nonce that is extracted from the "client/server
    write IV" part of the key block.)

    eap: fix EAPOL conversation tracking, fixes TLS decryption
    
    Use new heuristics based on the EAP Code field to determine whether a
    field originates from the client or server. This is more reliable than
    using "pinfo->match_uint" for two reasons: (1) the heuristics dissector
    does not set "match_uint" (resulting in an arbitrary match on the
    previous value) and (2) with EAP over EAPOL, there is no matching port
    number (resulting in two conversations with different addresses and port
    number zero).
    
    To fix TLS decryption, make sure to create a single conversation for
    both direction and allow the port type to be PT_NONE (to avoid reporting
    all packets as originating from the server).

    Remove unnecessary extcap_cleanup() declaration.
    
    That wasn't sufficient to avoid #ifdeffing calls to extcap_cleanup(), as
    this header wasn't even being included if HAVE_EXTCAP wasn't defined,
    hence change I18c855e13281013a6277c1f38eeac92e74d52b34 was necessary.
    
    It's probably best that this not be included if HAVE_EXTCAP isn't
    defined, so as to catch *other* references to functions etc. that aren't
    available without extcap.

    extcap: fix use-after-free for preferences
    
    In commit v2.3.0rc0-117-g485bc45 (backported to v2.2.0rc0-44-g66721ca),
    extcap_prefs_dynamic_vals and extcap_cleanup were added in an attempt to
    address dangling pointers.
    
    Unfortunately it is not sufficient:
    
     - A pointer to the preference value is stored in extcap_arg and passed
       to the prefs API, but this extcap_arg structure can become invalid
       which result in use-after-free whenever the preference is accessed.
     - On exit, a use-after-free occurs in prefs_cleanup when the preference
       value is being checked.
    
    As the preference subsystem actually manages the memory for the string
    value and consumers should only provide a pointer where the value can be
    stored, convert the char* field in extcap to char**. This has as
    additional benefit that values are not limited to 256 bytes anymore.
    
    extcap_cleanup is moved after epan_cleanup to ensure that prefs_cleanup
    does not operate on dangling pointers.
    
    Crash is reproducible under ASAN with: tshark -i randpkt

    Have "All Capture Files" match only capture files.
    
    We support reading some types of files that aren't capture files, in
    case we have a dissector for that file format (because, for example,
    it's often transported over HTTP).  Don't include them in the set of
    files "All Capture Files" matches; you can still look for them as they
    have individual entries in the drop-down menu of file type patterns.
    
    Ultimately, there should be Fileshark/TFileshark programs to read those
    files - and other file types, and even capture files if the goal is to
    look at the file structure rather than at the packets - and *that's* the
    program that should offer the ability to load JPEGs and so on.
    
    (No, this does not reduce the "All Capture Files" list down to a level
    that makes the problem in bug 12837 go away.  The right way to fix
    *that* is to arrange, somehow, that the "All Capture Files" entry not
    actually list all the suffixes it matches.)

    Remove name resolution from the file dialogs.
    
    A single name resolution checkbox was added to the file dialog way back
    in 2000 in g0f7cf64. At that time it was needed because resolution was
    synchronous and could drastically affect your load time. Since then
    we've added asynchronous name resolution and more recently made it
    mandatory (ge005bc8). We've also added more name resolution checkboxes
    and other controls.
    
    Remove the name resolution checkboxes. You can just as easily change
    resolution options before or after opening a file and they take up
    valuable real estate.
    
    Combine the size and packets in the Qt and Win32 dialogs and
    pretty-print the size. Combine the start and elapsed times in the Qt,
    Win32, and GTK+ dialogs. This lets us shrink the custom areas of the
    file dialogs even further. Make the default file type combo item more
    descriptive.

    Some messages related to LVB data are mistakenly treated as malformed.
    This patch fixes it by checking LVB flags before parsing LVB data.
    I found that "Convert lock" and "Unlock" use PUT_LVB flags, but "Proxy AST" uses GET_LVB flags.

    Changes to the IPP dissector:
    
        - xxx-time values are not UNIX timestamps (that is a CUPS-ism - they are
          time since bootup in IPP itself)
        - Change all of the display strings to use the official IANA values
          (confusing otherwise)
        - Add support for newer value/group tags.
        - Add support for all enum attribute values.
        - Add request/response tracking so you can easily match things up.
        - Decode octetString, rangeOfInteger, textWithLanguage, nameWithLanguage,
          dateTime, and resolution values.
        - Don't treat integers and enums as interchangeable (they aren't).
        - Integers and enums are signed integers.
        - Put operation id or status code in info column.

    Make the ws_strto* routines more like the strto* routines.
    
    Not all uses of atoi() or various strto* routines in Wireshark expect
    the string to contain *only* a number, so not all uses should require
    that the byte after the number be a '\0'.  Have the ws_strto* routines
    take a "pointer a pointer set to point to the character after the
    number" argument, and have the callers do the appropriate checks of the
    character after that.
    
    This fixes the VMS trace reading code so that it can read those files
    again.
    
    The get_ routines are handed command-line arguments, so they *do* expect
    the string to contain only a number; have them check to make sure the
    byte after the number is a '\0'.

    ssl: fix TLS renegotiation, add test for this
    
    A handshake starts a new session, be sure to clear the previous state to
    avoid creating a decoder with wrong secrets.
    
    Renegotiations are also kind of transparant to the application layer, so
    be sure to re-use an existing SslFlow. This fixes the Follow SSL stream
    functionality which would previously ignore everything except for the
    first session.
    
    The capture file contains a crafted HTTP request/response over TLS 1.2,
    interleaved with renegotiations. The HTTP response contains the Python
    script used to generate the traffic. Surprise!

    ssl: really fix session resumption expert info
    
    In a two-pass dissection with renegotiated sessions, the
    is_session_resumed flag is not updated according to the current protocol
    flow. Fix this by performing detection of abbreviated handshakes in
    all cases, do not limit it to the decryption stage (where ssl != NULL).
    
    Reset the resumption assumption after the first ChangeCipherSpec
    (normally from the server side, but explicitly add this in case client
    packets somehow arrive earlier in the capture). This should not have a
    functional effect on normal TLS captures with Session Tickets.

    Allow a lot more C99 features
    
    Flexible array members are supported by gcc, clang and even MSVC2013.
    Note, so far it was only used in the Windows-specific airpcap.h.
    
    Trailing commas in enum declaration are already in use since for
    these dissectors (commit ID is the first occurrence):
    epan/dissectors/packet-gluster.h v2.1.0rc0-1070-g3b706ba
    epan/dissectors/packet-ipv6.c v2.1.2rc0-81-ge07b4aa

    epan/dissectors/packet-quic.c v2.3.0rc0-457-gfa320f8
    
    Inline functions using the "inline" keyword are supported via all glib
    versions we support (if it is missing, glib will define a suitable
    inline macro).
    
    Other c99 functions listed in the README.developer document were found
    to be compatible with GCC 4.4.7, Clang 3.4.2 and MSVC 2013.

    Check for signs in unsigned numbers and fail if we see one.
    
    -1 is not an unsigned number.  For that matter, neither is +1;
    "unsigned" means "without a sign", and they both have signs.
    
    ANSI C's strto{whatever} routines - even the ones that supposedly are
    for "unsigned" values - and the GLib routines modeled after them allow a
    leading sign, so we have to check ourselves.

    Have scan_plugins() take an argument specify what to do on load failures.
    
    That's a less gross hack to suppress load failures due to not having
    libwiretap than providing a no-op failure-message routine, as it at
    least allows other code using a failure-message routine, such as
    cmdarg_err() and routines that call it, to be used.
    
    We really should put libwiretap and libwireshark plugins into separate
    subdirectories of the plugin directories, and avoid even looking at
    libwireshark plugins in programs that don't use libwireshark.

    cmake: fix libnl caching issue, make it more robust
    
    Dario reported that the cmake build fails after installing libnl3-devel
    (libnl-devel was already present). This results from a name collision
    for NL_LIBRARY and NL_INCLUDE_DIR variables.
    
    Initially these variables contained the values for libnl-1. When libnl3
    is installed, these variables were not updated (because it was cached),
    but HAVE_LIBNL3 would still be set, resulting in a header and feature
    mismatch. Use separate variables for libnl1 and libnl3 to fix this.
    
    Other fixes: also set HAVE_LIBNL for libnl1; fallback to libnl1 if
    libnl3 is unusable (e.g. because libnl-route-3.0 is missing).

    Reworked dissection of BGP Extended Community attributes
    
    This patch contains a partial rewrite of the BGP dissector for Extended
    Communities.  The changes were primarily motivated by my dissatisfaction
    with the generally unreadable way in which the types, names and values of
    BGP Extended Communities were displayed in Wireshark GUI.  The rewrite
    provides a hopefully more readable and eye-pleasing way of displaying the
    extended communities.  I have also corrected numerous other flaws with the
    Extended Community dissector I stumbled across.
    
    In particular, the changes encompass the following:
    
    1.) The Type octet of an Extended Community is now analyzed including its
    Authority and Transitivity bits.  These were not dissected before.
    
    2.) Dissection for EVPN Extended Community was improved.  The original
    implementation blindly assumed that there is just a single subtype and
    decoded the community ignoring the actual subtype.
    
    3.) I have removed the hf_bgp_ext_com_value_unknown16 and ..._unknown32.
    The current code uses a different approach to display values of unrecognized
    communities, and for recognized communities, there are no "unknown"
    subfields.
    
    4.) Removed a couple of variables declared at the
    dissect_bgp_update_ext_com() level.  These stored the result of a
    tvb_get_...() call but the value was used only once.  I have replaced them
    with the direct use of tvb_get_...()
    
    5.) Moved duplicate code to add the Type value into the community_tree from
    each branch in the switch(com_type_high_byte) out of it and placed it before
    the switch().
    
    6.) Reworked the style in which individual communities are displayed.  Each
    community item (collapsed) is now displayed using the following label
    format:
    
    Community name: Values [Generic community type]
    
    Examples:
    
    Route Target: 1:1 [Transitive 2-Octet AS-Specific]
    Unknown subtype 0x01: 0x8081 0x0000 0x2800 [Non-Transitive Opaque]
    Unknown type 0x88 subtype 0x00: 0x0000 0x0000 0x0000 [Unknown community]
    
    6.) To keep the filter names more consistent, changed names of selected filters:
    
    bgp.ext_com.type_high -> bgp.ext_com.type
    bgp.ext_com.type_low -> bgp.ext_com.stype_unknown
    
    In particular, I do not want to call the subtype as bgp.ext_com.type_low
    because that filter applied only to unrecognized subtypes even though its
    name would suggest to users that they can filter any community based on it.
    
    7.) Numerous corrections in text labels, names and labels that have been
    incorrect or incomplete.

    uat: fix memleak after parsing and on errors
    
    Memleaks could occur in these scenarios:
     - Two consecutive fields fail in their chk callback, overwriting the
       first heap-allocated error message.
     - After parsing one record, the internal record was never freed.
     - Syntax errors abort the parsing process and leaks the record and
       current field value.
    
    These leaks will only happen at startup, when the UAT files are read or
    when UAT strings are loaded (e.g. from the ssl.keys_list preference).

    gtk: fix compilation with GTK+ before 2.18
    
    Removed in v1.99.2rc0-399-g43f09e6, but some includes are still needed.
    
    Basically I looked for the functions defined in the
    ui/gtk/old-gtk-compat.h header file that were in files below ui/gtk/.
    Then I matched it against the removed part in the above commit and added
    the header back at its old place. In two other cases, the header was
    only needed for Windows.
    
    If the above commit did not reference the file, I checked which function
    was in use and added the header on top, removing redundant conditionals.
    
    Reported and tested by a user of GTK+ 2.12.12 on top of v2.0.5.

        pcapng: do not leak blocks
    
        pcapng_open and pcapng_read have 'wblock' allocated on the stack, so if
        they return, they do not have to set wblock.block to NULL.
    
        pcapng_read_block always sets wblock->block to NULL and may initialize
        it for SHB, IDB, NRB and ISB. Be sure to release the memory for IDB and
        ISB. It is better to have more wtap_block_free calls on a NULL value
        than missing them as this would be a memleak (on the other hand, do not
        release memory that is stored elsewhere such as SHB and NRB).

    *If* one of those is the cause, my guess is that it's the Diameter one,
    as the crash happens before any file is read (so it's probably not the
    pcapng one) and thus before any dissection is done (so it's probably not
    the XML dissector one).

    Use "ecatf" as the protocol name, to parallel everything else.
    
    The fields have names beginning with "ecatf.", the dissector is called
    "ecatf", and it's only the frame layer of EtherCAT anyway, so just call
    it "ecatf".

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Aug 30 15:51:54 2016 -0700

    Don't do any Decode As stuff for dissector tables not used with Decode As.
    
    Have all dissector tables have a "supports Decode As" flag, which
    defaults to FALSE, and which is set to TRUE if a register_decode_as()
    refers to it.
    
    When adding a dissector to a dissector table with a given key, only add
    it for Decode As if the dissector table supports it.
    
    For non-FT_STRING dissector tables, always check for multiple entries
    for the same protocol with different dissectors, and report an error if
    we found them.
    
    This means there's no need for the creator of a dissector table to
    specify whether duplicates of that sort should be allowed - we always do
    the check when registering something for "Decode As" (in a non-FT_STRING
    dissector table), and just don't bother registering anything for "Decode
    As" if the dissector table doesn't support "Decode As", so there's no
    check done for those dissector tables.

    pcapng: do not leak blocks
    
    pcapng_open and pcapng_read have 'wblock' allocated on the stack, so if
    they return, they do not have to set wblock.block to NULL.
    
    pcapng_read_block always sets wblock->block to NULL and may initialize
    it for SHB, IDB, NRB and ISB. Be sure to release the memory for IDB and
    ISB. It is better to have more wtap_block_free calls on a NULL value
    than missing them as this would be a memleak (on the other hand, do not
    release memory that is stored elsewhere such as SHB and NRB).

    qt: fix crash on Search Packet while redissecting
    
    Before redissection, PacketList::freeze() is called which clears the
    model. This results in a NULL-deref when pressing Ctrl-F (Packet
    Search) or Ctrl-G (Go To Packet). Reproducer: in a large capture file,
    enter some display filter (e.g. "udp") and immediately press Ctrl-F.
    
    Thanks to Github user SNAPESNATCH for the initial report via IRC that
    included a helpful stack trace on Windows.

    CMake: Allow setting per target compiler warnings
    
    Setting our compiler warning flags in CMAKE_C_FLAGS does not allow
    using different flags per target.
    
    Allow for that possibility by setting the internal WS_WARNINGS_{C,CXX}_FLAGS
    and using the COMPILE_OPTIONS property to set them.
    
    This change is just setting mechanism and there should be no difference
    in generated warnings.
    
    The check_X_compiler_flag cmake test is changed to test each flag individually.
    We need a list, not a space separated string, and the aggregate test is not
    significant.

    Also, note that dissect_netlink_error() should also check the message
    length, to make sure it doesn't run past the end of the message, and
    indicate why we are assuming an "integer" is 4 bytes (it's because the

    IEEE 802.15.4:dissecting header & payload information elements used by 6tisch.
    
    This patch shows the Information Elements (IE) defined by the
    IEEE802.15.4. It dissects the information of those IE which are used
    by the IETF WG 6tisch and announces the others. Here the list of the
    fully dissected ones:
    
    - For the header IEs:
        - Time Correction.
        - Header Termination 1.
        - Header Termination 2.
    
    - For the payload IEs:
        - MLME:
            - Nested Shorts:
                - TSCH Synchronization IE.
                - TSCH Timeslot IE.
                - TSCH Slotframe and Link IE.
            - Nested Longs:
                - Channel Hopping IE.
        - Payload Termination IE.
    
    For the rest of the IEs defined in the standart, this patch shows them
    but does not analyze their inner fields.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Aug 22 17:53:10 2016 -0700

    Handle quoted-pairs in quoted-strings correctly.
    
    Backslash, in a quoted-string, escapes quotes (and any other characters,
    although the only ones that *need* escaping are a double-quote and a
    backslash).
    
    This means that the value of a parameter isn't just the raw characters
    from the parameters string; for a quoted string, it needs to be
    un-escaped, and for a *non*-quoted string, it has to stop at the first
    non-token character (you can put comments in).  So
    ws_find_media_type_parameter() must return an allocated string with the
    actual value.
    
    Get rid of index_of_char(); it doesn't do anything that strchr() does.

    Pass an HTTP message type to all HTTP subdissectors.
    
    This gets complicated, because those subdissectors might be called by
    other dissectors as well.  We need a better way of passing that sort of
    out-of-bound information.
    
    Pull some routines used for processing Content-Type parameters into
    common code; we can't guarantee that the media parameters passed in
    would be writable (passing it as *the* data hid that; passing a
    structure with that *and* the HTTP message type revealed it), so don't
    convert it to lower-case in place.
    
    Use that information, if available, to determine whether an IPP message
    is a requet or a response.

    netlink-netfilter,nflog: use NFPROTO_xxx instead of AF_xxx
    
    These constants are mostly overlapping, except for NFPROTO_ARP. A manual
    study of the Linux v4.7 code shows which fields to use and also reveal
    that nflog.family can never be NFPROTO_ARP because (1) bridge traffic
    use NFPROTO_BRIDGE and (2) arptables has no ULOG/NFLOG target.
    
    This patch affects how some family fields are displayed but do not
    affect subdissector calls.

     - ROS Services are not detected.
     - Ideally, the TF topic should be dissected as it is a very common topic

    This can be useful when dealing with 1) captures from versions of

    appropriate and 2) DLT_CAN_SOCKETCAN_HOSTENDIAN captures if processed by
    a machine with a different byte order from the capturing machine with
    software that doesn't properly put the field into host byte order when
    reading and writing.

    netlink: fix flags dissection
    
    Flags are not in network byte order, use given encoding instead.
    
    Show both flags fields for GET and NEW requests since the netlink
    dissector cannot yet determine whether a request is for GET, NEW or
    something else. This has no effect for the sockdiag dissector but it
    will influence the route and netfilter netlink subdissectors.

    dissector ISAKMP: Added decryption using AES-GCM, AES-CCM and AES-CTR
    
    Added support for decryption of IKEv2 packets encrypted with PAED or CTR
    cipher mode.
    Verification of integrity requires libgcrypt 1.6.0 or later. If it is
    not the case, only decryption is performed
    Can easily be extended to other ciphers supported by libgcrypt.
    
    NOTE: There is long-term bug in handling UAT for IKEv2 - any change
    resulting in change count of IKEv2 UAT entries causes crash when
    matching key from UAT is found.
    Crash does not occur when UAT is read from user prefs file.
    I observed this bug also on stock 1.10.6 version from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    
    I have no knowledge, how to fix it.

    Handle the new LINKTYPE_CAN_SOCKETCAN_HOSTENDIAN.
    
    Unfortunately, only one libpcap code path puts the CAN ID in the
    SocketCAN header in network byte order; the others leave it in host byte
    order.  Therefore, a new LINKTYPE_/DLT_ value was introduced, and
    libpcap was changed to use that for the cases where the CAN ID is in
    host byte order.  Support them both.
    
    This means we need to, when reading pcap and pcapng files, fix up the
    CAN ID if the host that wrote the file has a different byte order from
    ours (as libpcap also now does).  This includes Linux "cooked" captures,
    which can include CAN packets.

    SEL Protocol - Fix 'Fast Meter Config' sub-tree addition typo & 'if (tree)' usage
    
    - The proto_tree_add_subtree call was previously using the length of the full tvb,
    instead of len-2 like all other calls.  This typo did not previously cause an issue,
    but in newer versions of Wireshark it causes an assert.
    
    - When I created the selfm dissector 4-5 years ago, I used packet-synphasor.c
    as a template and there was an 'if (tree)' wrapper around several initial GUI calls
    including col_*** info column clear/set functions.  It looks like in recent years
    this layout has been removed (for example, https://code.wireshark.org/review/#/c/6725/ ).
    I'm not sure of the exact reasoning behind this, but in Wireshark 2.x (QT), there are
    several conditions where in the SEL protocol dissector the info column will be
    cleared and not repopulate - I can only assume because col_clear has been called
    with no col_add's.  Removal of this 'if' condition does correct the issue with no immediate ill effects..

    Qt: fix crash on clearing dfilter after capture restart
    
    Since v2.1.2rc0-1-gaf5daa6 ("Qt: Replace a QMap with a QVector."), the
    following error could be observed:
    
        ASSERT failure in QVector<T>::operator[]: "index out of range", file /usr/include/qt/QtCore/qvector.h, line 433
        Aborted (core dumped)
    
    It happens when a capture filter is present and a live capture is
    restarted. Then the number_to_row_ structure would be truncated which
    results in an invalid access.
    
    Fix this by always checking the length before inserting a new mapping.
    Do it inside the loop to prevent an unlikely race condition where more

Date:   Wed Aug 17 19:03:11 2016 -0700

    Don't distinguish between PARSED_NONRECORD and PARSE_FAILED.
    
    If we got no bytes of data from a putative packet, the file isn't a
    valid Ascend file, regardless of whether the parser failed or not.  Just
    have parse_ascend() return a Boolean, TRUE if we got a packet and FALSE
    if not, and, in the case where we got no data but the parser didn't
    fail, provide "no data returned by parse" as the error string.
    
    (We weren't actually distinguishing between them when we called
    parse_ascend() - we were treating all non-PARSED_RECORD returns as an
    error.)

    Implement support for SCTE-35 switching messages.
    
    This module implements a dissector for the main table in a SCTE-35 message, a
    splice_info_section. This payload is carried in a MPEG Section Table with a
    table ID of 0xFC. PIDs carrying this sort of table are also noted in the PMT
    with a stream type of 0x86, and a registration descriptor with fourcc 'CUEI'.
    
    The various splice command types are implemented in separate modules, and are
    linked to this dissector through the field scte35.splice_command_type. Field
    names follow the conventions documented in the SCTE35 specification.
    
    This dissector does not support encrypted SCTE35 messages, other than
    indication through the scte35.encrypted_packet flag.
    
    The SCTE-35 protocol is described by the Society of Cable Telecommunications
    Engineers at <https://www.scte.org/documents/pdf/Standards/Top%20Ten/ANSI_SCTE%2035%202013.pdf>.

    make-version.pl: make it work with git worktrees
    
    When using git worktrees, the .git file is a regular file pointing to
    the original git repository. Accept this case too. Also ignore the fact
    that the original repo could be a git-svn repo, that is very unlikely.
    
    Example workflow (requires git 2.5):
    
        # Assume work in progress in current tree. Goal is to quickly do a
        # fix in another branch and publish the changes without interfering
        # with the WIP and without marking all files out of date (which
        # slows down re-compilation).
        git worktree add /tmp/wireshark-2.2 master-2.2
        pushd /tmp/wireshark-2.2        # go to temporary tree
        git cherry-pick -x COMMIT       # backport the fix
        git review                      # submit for review
        popd                            # go back to original tree
        rm -rf /tmp/wireshark-2.2 && git worktree prune     # cleanup
        # now continue working where you left work

    Allocate all the wmem maps with epan scope.
    
    That doesn't seem to affect the performance negatively (or
    positively...) to any noticeable degree with my simple "run tshark under
    the time command with an empty file" tests, and it does appear to reduce
    the amount of memory that valgrind thinks is leaked.
    
    All the other maps were already allocated with epan scope, so do that
    with these as well.

    Fix IKEv1 decryption and initialization vectors
    
    Generate initialization vectors during Wireshark's first pass,
    in order to improve reliability and efficiency. (bug #12699)
    Remove a dissection shortcut in first pass to allow early analysis
    of the transform payloads, which is needed to find out the crypto
    algorithms.
    
    Introduce a hash table to store an IV per message ID. (bug #12610)
    Fix handling of the initial phase 1 IV. (bug #12620)
    Cache IVs as per-packet data instead of a list.
    
    Use the wmem allocator to avoid memory leaks.
    Ensure libgcrypt resource cleanup on error paths.
    
    Rely only on IKE attributes to find the decryption algorithm,
    do not consider the length of the user-configured secret at this point.
    
    Split code into small functions.

    Use -r rather than -i for the "via stdin" tests.
    
    TShark, at least when running in one-pass mode, now supports reading
    from the standard input if the file format is one that *can* be read
    purely sequentially; both pcap and pcapng can be read purely
    sequentially (unlike, for example, Microsoft Network Monitor format,
    where you have to read the frame table, at the end of the file, before
    you can read the frames, meaning you have to seek backwards, which you
    can't do on a pipe).
    
    Using -r 1) tests the "read from standard input" path, which we should
    do in versions that support it, and 2) means we can check whether, for
    the crashes we're seeing on 32-bit Windows 8.1, it's a problem with
    reading from the standard input in general, or just a problem with
    *capturing* from the standard input.

    netlink-netfilter: add NFQUEUE dissection
    
    Update fields to Linux 4.7, add dissection for most important NFQUEUE
    structures and attributes. The shared Netfilter header is also dissected
    here (except when the NFLOG subdissector is called). Based on the source
    code of Linux and libnl, it seems that most (all?) fields are big
    endian.
    
    Tested with netlink.pcap and netlink-nflog.pcap from the SampleCaptures
    wiki page.

    The gui.column module is somehow special, it has no name since it is
    part of the gui module. This causes a crash when trying to invoke

    Always look up prefs inside gui_column_module when the given prefs
    module is "column" instead of matching two specific names.

    The Ubuntu packaged Ply 3.7 with Ubuntu 16.04's Python makes
    ASN.1 based dissector generation fail.
    
    Ply's API changed after 3.5 and the small change to asn2wrs.py
    adapts to that.
    The commit breaking the API in Ply's repository is the following:

    Add OSI Layer 4 to exported PDU to handle TCP and UDP payloads.
    
    This allows for much easier anonymized captures for protocols running
    atop TCP/UDP.
    
    Added support for "TCP dissector data" tag within export PDU (34) so that
    the tcpinfo struct that TCP dissector normally passes to its subdissectors
    can be saved.

    extcap: Use stderr to print error message
    
    This patch reads out the stderr messages from an extcap
    utility and displays it to an user. It was tested on Qt
    but not on GTK, but should work their as well.
    
    On Mac OS/X and Windows the child_watch does not behave
    as it was intended. Therefore in extcap_cleanup, the callbacks
    are called manually, if and only if, they have not been
    called already.
    
    The reason why it displays two error messages is, that
    by the time the first one is being displayed, glib has not
    returned from the spawned process on Linux yet. So there
    is no way to add the stderr correctly, and putting a handler
    to stderr into interface_opts will lead to memory errors,
    cause then the code tries to access memory outside of its
    protection.

    Register IPv6 extension header dissectors to "ip.proto" table
    
    We may want to add expert infos for IPv6 extension headers over IPv4 (TODO).
    Any side-effects that don't make sense (e.g: IPv6 Routing over IPv4) are
    ignored.
    
    The IPv6 Next Header decode as is replaced by IP Proto decode as. It
    didn't fit a conceptual model well and it also was not working very well
    in practice (for multiple extension headers).
    
    We now support decoding any IP Protocol number as an extension header.

        Python pidl: avoid segfault with "del obj->attr"
    
        Deleting an attribute in Python (using the "del" statement) is (at
        some stages along a winding path, for C objects) converted into
        setting the attribute to NULL. Not None, actual NULL. The way we
        handled this NULL was to dereference it. This changes the behaviour to
        raising an AttributeError, which is more or less what Python does in
        similar situations with builtin objects.

    capabilities of the decoder.
    
    Fix this issue by making the decoder hold a pointer to the (constant)
    SslCipherSuite structure rather than making a copy (and have the decoder
    point to that data).
    
    I also considered resetting the decoder once the cipher suite changes in
    the Server Hello, but that breaks renegotiation.

    IPv6: Use ipv6_pinfo_t instead of ws_ip to keep some state
    
    To perform IPv6 defragmentation we need to compute the IPv6 fragment header
    payload length by subtracting the length of intermediate extension headers
    from the IPv6 payload length.
    
    Add a new frag_plen field to ipv6_pinfo_t to do that instead of (ab)using
    struct ws_ip.
    
    Note: The RFC 2460 rules for fragment header order are stricter than the code
    suggests but that shouldn't be a problem here.

    Fix checkAPI.pl warnings about printf
    
    Many of the complaints from checkAPI.pl for use of printf are when its embedded
    in an #ifdef and checkAPI isn't smart enough to figure that out.
    The other (non-ifdef) use is dumping internal structures (which is a type of
    debug functionality)
    Add a "ws_debug_printf" macro for printf to pacify the warnings.

    Enable "Save As..." iff cf_can_save_as() returns TRUE.
    
    Currently, cf_can_save() really means "*there's something to save* and
    we can write it out"; "Save As..." should be enabled even if there are
    no changes to save, in case the user just wants to write the existing
    file contents out to a new file and have the new file be the current
    file.  That matches the behavior of the GTK+ version.
    
    (We might want to enable "Save" even if there are no changes to save;
    some other programs do that, such as the TextEdit, WordPad, KWrite, and
    gedit simple text editors.  If so, however, we should make "Save" write
    stuff out even if there are no changes to save.
    
    Note, however, that we're a bit different from most "editors", in that
    we don't read the entire file into memory - we keep the file open and
    read packet data from it, because we want to be able to read files that
    won't fit into memory.  That *might* change what we ultimately want to
    do with "Save".)

    packet-ehdlc: Update with results from better understanding the protocol
    
    The Ericsson HDLC format inside L2TP is not publicly documented, so when
    I originally wrote the code, I was basically just looking at hex-dumps
    of protocol traces and trying to ge an initial understanding. By now,
    that understanding has significantly matured, so let's update the
    dissector accordingly.
    
    The major changes are regarding the understanding that there is not a
    message type, but in fact a compressed SAPI and compressed TEI field.
    
    Based on this, we can discriminate on whether there will be a HDLC/LAPD
    header to follow, or whether there's actual user data (TRAU frame
    replacement) following.

    sshdump: Change ws_close to closesocket
    
    ws_close just calls _close(); that doesn't close sockets.  closesocket()
    is the API to close a socket on Windows, and is defined as close()
    on UN*X, so using closesocket() will close sockets on Windows and UN*X.
    
    This way, we close the pipe socket correctly on Windows.
