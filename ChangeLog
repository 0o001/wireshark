    voip_calls_dialog/voip_calls: Fix for duplicated entries after retap
    
    Issue seen from 2.6:
    1) Open pcap with any VoIP call
    2) Open Telephony->VoIP calls
    3) Select one or more calls
    4) Press Flow Sequence - sequence is shown
    5) Close Flow Sequence
    6) Press Play Streams - Play dialog is shown
    7) Close Play dialog
    8) Press Flow Sequence - sequence is shown, but all entries are duplicated
    
    If you repeat 6-7 multiple times, all entries are shown multiple times in 8
    
    Patch adds missing clear of graph_analysis before retaping the stream.
    Tested on master, but should be backported to as many stable branches as possible.

    In the case for an RDMA Read Request which does not have

    not process this packet as an LNet layer instead of
    labeling it as a malformed packet.

    Make the TTL field unsigned, but keep warning if the high-order bit is set.
    
    See RFC 2181, section 8 (and RFC 1035 erratum 2130, which notes that
    section 3.2.1 says the TTL is signed but section 4.1.3 says it's
    unsigned); RFC 2181 section 8 says "unsigned, but avoid sending values
    that have the uppermost bit set, and treat values with the uppermost bit
    set as a value of 0".  (STD 13 = RFC 1034, the "concepts and facilities"

    Back up to the beginning of the file if we don't have a gzip header.
    
    If the first byte of the file is 31, and we advance to the next byte but
    find it's not 139, back up to the first byte before falling through and
    treating the file as uncompressed.
    
    Add/expand some comments while we're at it.
