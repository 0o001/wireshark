    Qt: Make sure shortcuts are visible in context menus.
    
    As of Qt 5.10, context menu shortcuts can be hidden:
    
    https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-61181
    
    Add set_action_shortcuts_visible_in_context_menu to qt_ui_utils and call
    it for our context menus as needed. For Qt 5.{10,11,12} it calls
    QAction::setShortcutVisibleInContextMenu(true).
    
    For Qt 5.13 and later, call
    QStyleHints::setShowShortcutsInContextMenus(true) in
    WiresharkApplication.

    Qt: Don't plot zero values in I/O scatter plots
    
    We don't currently distinguish between missing and zero values in I/O
    graphs. This can be problematic in scatter plots since the plot points
    tend to show up as chartjunk which overwhelms the X axis. In plain,
    non-calculated plots assume that zero values mean "missing" and omit
    those points.
    
    Describe this in the User's Guide, but comment the text out for now
    pending a full update to the I/O Graph section.
    
    Switch to title case in our default graphs. Make the TCP Errors graph
    red by default.

    6) Press Play Streams - Play dialog is shown
    7) Close Play dialog
    8) Press Flow Sequence - sequence is shown, but all entries are duplicated
    
    If you repeat 6-7 multiple times, all entries are shown multiple times in 8
    
    Patch adds missing clear of graph_analysis before retaping the stream.
    Tested on master, but should be backported to as many stable branches as possible.

    NSIS: Don't package .pdb files.
    
    We run `windeployqt ... --pdbs` at build time, which means that we need
    to be careful not to include them in the NSIS package. Switch from using
    wildcards ("File ...\*") to using separate "File" commands for each file.
    
    Simplify the PDB Zip package command while we're here.

Author: João Valverde <joao.valverde@tecnico.ulisboa.pt>
Date:   Sat Jan 4 17:31:11 2020 +0000

    IPv4: Fix incorrect expert info for IGMP TTL
    
    IGMP uses TTL = 1 for the network control block. The code assumes
    a certain registered multicast destination address always carries
    traffic for that protocol, which isn't true. For example mDNS
    usually uses a TTL of 255 but IGMP Membership reports use a TTL
    of 1 for the same destination address.
    
    The end result is that IGMP traffic to mDNS multicast destination
    shows a confusing and incorrect "TTL != 255 for the Local Network
    Control Block" expert info.
    
    Rename the "ttl" variable for clarity.
