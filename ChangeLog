    ncp: fix handling of NDS List requests and replies.
    
    In requests:
    
    There appear to be 2 bytes of unknown data (typically 0) after the
    2-byte Request Flags field (are they just 2 bytes of additional flags?).
    Skip past them before dissecting the iterator.
    
    If there are no bytes remaining in the packet after the parent ID, stop
    dissecting; some packets seem to stop there.  For those requests, assume
    that the response will contain :
    
            entry ID;
            entry flags;
            subordinate count;
            modification time;
            base class;
            relative distinguished name;
    
    although the last of those might be something else (it appears to be of
    the form "CN={name}").
    
    In replies:
    
    For each returned entry, if the requested field flags in the request had
    the DSI_OUTPUT_FIELDS bit set, fetch the returned field flags and use
    that to determine what fields are present; otherwise, use the requested
    field flags.

commit 9412acb7e8
Author: Guy Harris <gharris@sonic.net>
Date:   Tue Sep 22 17:47:43 2020 +0000

    ncp: fix setting elements of an ncp_record structure.
    
    In dissect_nds_request():
    
    Fill in fieds of the ncp_record structure only on the first pass; once
    the first pass is complete, the structure's fully filled in.
    
    That fixes cases where NDS replies aren't fully dissected because the
    NDS verb isn't added to the ncp_record structure when the request is
    dissected.
    
    Fill in elements as soon as we have the value needed to fill it in, so
    that it's filled in even if we throw an exception later, and so that
    it's filled in only if we have the value in the packet, so that a valid
    value isn't overwritten by a later packet that doesn't have the value.
    
    This fixes cases where, in the second pass, NDS replies aren't fully
    dissected because the NDS verb is overwritten in the ncp_record
    structure when a continuation of the request is dissected.
    
    Note that we should perhaps make the object_name field a pointer to a
    wmem-allocated string, so that NULL can indicate "not set, hence not
    known".

    Add a verify_merge_request routine to validate-commit.py. If the
    required CI_MERGE_REQUEST_XXX environment variables are set it uses them
    to query the GitLab API to see if "allow_collaboration" is true in the
    current merge request.
    
    This is a ham-fisted way of ensuring that committers can rebase and can
    be removed if and when https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/23308
    is fixed.

    ncp: fix a copy-and-pasteo.
    
    In process_multivalues(), we create a protocol item for the attribute
    syntax, but we don't fetch its value, and don't pass it to
    print_nds_values() as the syntax argument; instead, we pass a variable
    that wee initialize to 0, but never set.  (One of the disadvantages of
    preemptively initializing local variables is that data flow analyzers in
    compilers and static analyzers can't point out that you didn't set the
    variables in question to *useful* values.)
    
    This fixes the dissection of NDS Read replies.

    SAP: make the Server Name field FT_STRINGZPAD.
    
    According to the Novell IPX Router Specification, Chapter 4 "Service
    Advertising Protocol (SAP)":
    
            Server Name
    
            This field contains the 48 byte character string name that is
            assigned to a server.  The Server Name, in combination with the
            Service Type, uniquely identifies a server on an internetwork.
            Although SAP response packets always include the full 48 bytes
            for this field, typical server names are usually less than 48
            characters long and are ASCII NULL terminated.  The contents of
            the unused bytes which follow the NULL terminator are undefined.
    
    which seems to indicate that a full 48-byte name will not have a null
    termintor.  It also indicates that the field isn't null-padded, just
    "null-terminated if it's not terminated by the end of the field's fixed
    length"; perhaps we need to distinguish between the former and the
    latter, although it's not clear what would be a good short name for the
    latter.
    
    In any case, it sounds as if it's not guaranteed to be null-terminated.

    GitLab CI: Don't run validate-commit.py or cppcheck.
    
    Commits in release branches are typically cherry-picked from master,
    which means that:
    
    - We've presumably validated the commit message there.
    
    - The "(cherry picked from commit ..." line that GitLab adds might have
      extra newlines which fail the whitespace check.
    
    cppcheck.sh hasn't had any of the efficiency improvements backported,
    which means that it can take an excruciating amount of time to run.

    BSSMAP: Fix malformed packet exception on correct packet
    
    Both osmocom and TTCN3 Titan are parsing Handover Request with an IPv6
    Transport layer Address just fine, but wireshark was showing it as
    malformed. Parsing the address similar to what is done in IPv4 fixes the
    issue.

    TCP: do not use an unknown status when the checksum is 0xffff
    
    Otherwise it triggers an assert when adding the column as the field is
    defined as BASE_NONE and not BASE_DEC or BASE_HEX. Thus an unknown value
    (not in proto_checksum_vals[)array) cannot be represented.
    Mark the checksum as bad even if we process the packet.

    dicom: Handle frames with segments from different reassemblies
    
    There can be multiple PDV segments in the same frame that belong to
    different reassemblies. Change the reassembly_id used for the
    reassembly tables so that it is not identical for all segments in
    the same presentation context (but still unique for a given reassembly),
    so that that case can be handled properly. Otherwise fragment_add_seq_next
    will retrieve the wrong reassembly for one of the segments (especially
    on the second pass.)

    There are undefined bytes which must be included in DHCP
    suboption block according to DCP Block Length. In other
    words, there are still bytes after dissection of defined
    parameters finish but DCP block length does not finish.
    In order to solve the problem, these bytes are included in
    DHCP suboption block and marked Undefined. The byte number
    can be 1, so bytes word in pn_user_data is changed to byte.

    dicom: fix exporting objects with tshark
    
    The names for files extracted from data PDVs depend on information in the tags.
    Need to read the tags for data PDVs if the Export Objects tap has a listener
    even if there isn't a tree (so that tshark works) and need to send data to
    Export Objects only after reading the tags (so that it works on the first pass).
    This makes the tshark single pass behavior match wireshark GUI behavior.
