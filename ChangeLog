    Qt: Don't use QString::toLocal8Bit().

    As the QString::toLocal8Bit() documentation says,

    "On Unix systems this is equivalen to toUtf8(), on Windows the systems
    current code page is being used."

    This is problematic for the Packet Comments dialog, since the comments
    need to be UTF-8 as per the pcapng specification. Use toUtf8() instead
    there.

    Remove the toLocal8Bit() calls from the Extcap Options dialog since they
    weren'nt needed.

    Blind attempt at fixing #18698.

    nxp_802154_sniffer: Add heuristics

    UDP port 49999 is not IANA registered, so add some heuristics
    to the NXP 802.15.4 sniffer so that it doesn't claim packets
    from other protocols that have chosen that ephemeral port.

    Don't return 0 after already adding things to the tree; do that
    check in the heuristics.

    bpv6: Prevent infinite loops

    display_extension_block is supposed to return the current offset,
    not the number of bytes remaining, which can be less than the current
    offset and cause an infinite loop. In the case of errors, set
    lastheader and return the current offset to break out of loops.

    openflow_v6: Prevent infinite loops in too short ofp_stats

    The ofp_stats struct length field includes the fixed 4 bytes.
    If the length is smaller than that, report the length error
    and break out. In particular, a value of zero can cause
    infinite loops if this isn't done.

    Qt: Fix the ByteViewText line height.

    QFontMetrics::leading() was zero for Consolas on Windows in Qt5, but is
    nonzero in Qt6. This revealed that we were inconsistently using height()
    and leading() to calculate our line height. Just use lineSpacing()
    instead.

    Fixes #18438.

    CMake: Updates for CMake 3.25 and later on Windows.

    https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.25.html says:

    "On Windows, when targeting the MSVC ABI, the find_library() command now
    accepts .a file names after first considering .lib. This is symmetric
    with existing behavior when targeting the GNU ABI, in which the command
    accepts .lib file names after first considering .a."

    If "MSVC" is defined, only search for libsmi-2. This keeps us from finding
    libsmi.a. Set NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH when we're searching for zlib. This
    keeps us from finding Strawberry Perl's version.

    Some SpanDSP builds link with LibTIFF, but our Windows version doesn't.

    skinny: Convert parse_xml2skinny_dissector.py to Py3

    Convert parse_xml2skinny_dissector.py to Python 3.
    This is mostly the output of running 2to3, but some of the
    uses of dict.keys() were left as is instead of being converted
    to lists, since only membership was tested.

    The dissector still needs to be regenerated, which will happen
    in a next commit, so that this change can be easily backported.

    According to TS 26.101, AMR_SID payload is 39 bits.

    This fixes incorrect dissecting of Osmux frames containing AMR_SID
