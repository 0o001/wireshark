commit b307ffe
Author: AndersBroman <anders.broman@ericsson.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 13 09:34:16 2015 +0100

    Implement proto_tree_add_item_ret_int() and proto_tree_add_item_ret_uint() which
    works as proto_tree_add_item(), but also returns the value of (u)ints
    of 8,16,24 and 32 bits length in a 32 bit variable. It's based on Hadriels
    previous work.

    Replace enumerated preference for choosing subdissector with a subdissector table and Decode As functionality.
    
    This makes it much easier for other subdissectors (and plugins) to associate themselves with CAN.

    Eliminate decode_bitfield_value from "public" use.
    
    This "encourages" (forces) dissectors to use the bitmask field of the header_field_info structure to get "bitmask formatting" of a field.
    
    other_decode_bitfield_value should be treated the same (eventually eliminated), but there are still replacements to be made in the dissectors.

    Fix "Save All" for Export Objects.
    
    Fix the loop that goes through all the objects to be saved so that it
    looks at all the objects to be saved rather than repeatedly looking at
    the first object.
    
    When letting the user select a directory in which to save, restrict them
    to looking at directories.
    
    QDir doesn't do what we actually want here - QDir.setCurrent() might do
    a chdir() but it doesn't appear to set the QDir's path, so when we use
    it to construct pathnames it constructs them based on
    wsApp->lastOpenDir() rather than the directory the user selected.  Use
    Boring Old GLib's g_build_filename(), as we do in the GTK+ version, for
    now.  (It also does something we *don't* want, namely, at least as the
    documentation implies, a chdir().)

    CMake: Update wslua build and test.

    directory.
    
    Copy lua scripts to DATAFILE_DIR instead of DATAFILE_DIR/lua. That's
    where init.lua looks for console.lua.
    
    Always set WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY when testing. We
    presumably want to test our source files and not files which may or
    may not be in the system path.
    
    When we're running from the build directory look for lua scripts in both
    the Autotools and CMake build locations.

Date:   Thu Feb 26 13:02:06 2015 -0800

    Qt: Allow multiple lines in the packet list.
    
    Remove the setUniformRowHeights(true) call in the PacketList
    constructor. This means that the packet list now calculates its height
    by querying the Qt::SizeHintRole for every item instead of simply
    multiplying item_height * number_of_rows.
    
    Implement SizeHintRole in PacketListModel::data so that size
    calculations aren't unbearably slow. We don't have any row text until an
    item is drawn (via DisplayRole), so items with multiple lines end up
    being rendered twice. Note where we make assumptions on line heights.
    
    Although we call gtk_tree_view_set_fixed_height_mode() in the GTK+ UI we
    don't have this problem there. GTK+ is apparently less strict about
    enforcing row heights.

    To avoid frequent reallocations, the expected length is used as initial

    ssl,dtls: fix CertificateVerify dissection for TLSv1.2
    
    TLSv1.2 gained an additional SignatureAndHashAlgorithm field for fields
    marked with the digitally-signed attribute. This was already implemented
    before for ServerKeyExchange, let's reuse that.
    
    Note that the SignatureAndHashAlgorithm tree and fields (hash algo,
    signature algo) are repurposed in a different context, but since the
    structure is the same it is kept like this.
    
    By the way, add support for DTLSv1.2 too. RFC 6347 section 4.2.6
    suggests that the implementation is the same (as far as the dissector is
    concerned).
    
    Also update the comments and remove the additional "Signature with
    client's private key" subtree since the CertificateVerify message has no
    other items.

    Fix buffer overflow in 802.11 decryption
    
    The sha1 function outputs a multiple of 20 bytes while the ptk buffer
    has only a size of 64 bytes. Follow the hint in 802.11i-2004, page 164
    and use an output buffer of 80 octets.
    
    Noticed when running Wireshark with ASAN, on exit it would try to free a
    "next" pointer which was filled with sha1 garbage. It probably got
    triggered via 3f8fbb734915aaf74eb006898e8fabb007afbf48 which made
    AirPDcap responsible for managing its own memory.

    forces: make redirecttlv robust to invalid lengths
    
    Fixes a potential infinite loop reported by Vlad Tsyrklevich found via the
    "joern" tool. I'm pretty sure the semantics of proto_tree_add_item would have
    prevented this, but not 100% and making it explicit doesn't hurt.

    Qt: fix heap use-after-free wrt. data sources
    
    When a different packet is changed, the packet scoped memory for tvbuff
    is freed before clearing data source tabs. This results in
    heap-use-after free when resizeEvent is called as a result of clearing
    tabs for data sources.
    
    Avoid resize events by hiding the tabs.

    alljoyn: more robust signature handling
    
    There were two bugs in the handling of all-joyn struct signatures:
     - we were advancing the pointer without decrementing the length remaining
     - we were not checking for the string's null-terminator (which is only
       necessary if the string is malformed, but that's entirely possible)

    tcp: support variable-length tcp_dissect_pdus
    
    Originally suggested by Bill Meier for the MQTT protocol[1], but the
    Websocket protocol can also benefit from this. Since
    DESEGMENT_ONE_MORE_SEGMENT is a valid packet length, use the zero length
    instead as an indicator that the length is not yet known.
    
    Updated documentation too and remove the function documentation from
    packet-tcp.c since it is duplicated in packet-tcp.h.
    
    A noteworthy WSDG change is that the get_pdu_len parameter of
    tcp_dissect_pdus gained another void pointer since
    v1.99.2rc0-890-gceb8d95 ("Lua: Expose tcp_dissect_pdus() to Lua").
