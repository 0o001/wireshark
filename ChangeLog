    Update to WinSparkle 0.5.3.
    
    Update our WinSparkle package to 0.5.3. This fixes a file deletion bug.
    Note that WinSparkle now supports application shutdown callbacks, which
    should let us fix bugs 9687 and 12989.

    cops: try to avoid uninitialized warning error
    
    Valgrind 3.11.0 on the Ubuntu 16.04 buildbot reports that
    cops_call->solicited is not initialized:
    
        pdus_array = (GPtrArray *)wmem_map_lookup(cops_conv_info->pdus_tree, GUINT_TO_POINTER(handle_value));
        /* ... */

                                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    
    which is clearly bogus since the only place where cops_call could be
    created is a few lines up:
    
        ver_flags = tvb_get_guint8(tvb, offset);
        is_solicited = (lo_nibble(ver_flags) == 0x01);
        /* ... */
        pdus_array = (GPtrArray *)wmem_map_lookup(cops_conv_info->pdus_tree, GUINT_TO_POINTER(handle_value));
        if (pdus_array == NULL) {
            pdus_array = g_ptr_array_new();
            wmem_map_insert(cops_conv_info->pdus_tree, GUINT_TO_POINTER(handle_value), pdus_array);

        cops_call->solicited = is_solicited;
        /* ... */
        g_ptr_array_add(pdus_array, cops_call);
    
    Try to zero the whole structure to avoid this bogus warning.

    packet-rpcrdma: Fix protocol frame pre-detection
    
    The current mechanism of detecting RPC-over-RDMA is broken because
    it treats the Read list as a counted array (it's a list); and treats
    the Write list and Reply chunk identically (one is a list, one is
    always a single chunk).
    
    While we're here, refactor pre-detection helper functions so they
    can be used during frame dissection as well.

    Qt: fix crash when closing RTP player while playing
    
    For some time, the RTP Player has been crashing for me (Arch Linux, Qt
    5.7.0) when the RTP Player is active (affects also Wireshark 2.0.5).
    
    This call trace was observed:
    
        + RtpPlayerDialog::reject (closing dialog via Escape / Close button)
          + RtpAudioStream::stopPlaying
            + RtpAudioStream::outputStateChanged(QAudio::StoppedState)
              + QAudioOutput::deleteLater   // problematic!
          + RtpPlayerDialog::~RtpPlayerDialog
            + RtpAudioStream::~RtpAudioStream
    
    As the QAudioOutput instance is a child of RtpAudioStream, it is also
    destroyed after that. QAudioOutput's destructor somehow invokes (via
    libqtmedia_pulse.so) a main loop iteration which invokes the previously
    scheduled deleteLater call.
    
    As QAudioOutput was already being destructed, this results in a crash.
    Workaround this by removing this child from RtpAudioStream (no cruelty
    intended).

    BGP: Fix length in decode_prefix4()
    
    When decode_prefix4() gets called with more prefixes the length of
    proto_tree_add_subtree_format() should not be the total length.
    
    As the "Withdrawn route" part was the only one where decode_prefix4() has
    been called with a tlen not equal 0 we can eliminate the tlen parameter.
