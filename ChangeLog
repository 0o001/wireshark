    catapult,irda: Fix ASAN crashes due to buffer underrun
    
    The catapult dissector tripped on this random file I had. A quick look
    at other dissectors which use a construct like "-1] *= '*\\[rn]" showed
    packet-irda too, so fix that as well.

    Don't return an error string for NO_INTERFACES_FOUND.
    
    Most callers of capture_interface_list() don't expect an error string
    for NO_INTERFACES_FOUND, because that's not really an error, it's just a
    statement of face (and perhaps an error of 0 should be returned), so
    they don't bother freeing the error string, causing a leak.
    
    Instead, have the one place that *did* expect it to return an error
    string just put "No interfaces found" itself.
    
    Also, have that place not check for an error string if interfaces *were*
    found, as no error code or string is returned in that case.

    Prepend $(srcdir)/ to the sources in install commands, and get rid of
    the -T flag, as it's GNU coreutils install-specific; some versions of
    install don't support -T at all, and FreeBSD's install has a -T flag
    that takes an argument and has a completely different meaning.

    Fix bug9931 'Encapsulated ethernet packets sometimes show invalid FCS'
    
    This fixes part-1 of bug9931: the uninitialized use of a wtap_pkthdr
    struct. The second part of the bug deals with dissectors calling
    the Ethernet dissector for ecnapsulated Ethernet packets but using
    the wrong dissector handle to do so. That's unrelated to the issue this
    commit addresses, so I'm splitting them up.

    isakmp: allow IKEv1 decryption with non-PSK authentication
    
    There is a check that disables decryption for non-PSK authentication. It
    has been around ever since its introduction in commit acfe071e (svn
    r17229). As suggested in bug 7951, remove this check to allow decryption
    for e.g. certificates authentication.

    Fix corruption when saving to a pcapng file if number of name resolution entries exceeds max NRB block size.
    
    Specifically: When saving to a pcapng file,
    an incorrect name resolution block (NRB) length was written
    if the number of name resolution entries to be written was larger than
    the maximum number of entries which could fit into a single NRB block.
    
    Fixes Bug #10145.
