    wmem: make wmem_strsplit behave more like g_strsplit
    
    In the past "g_strsplit" users were converted to use "wmem_strsplit" to
    avoid memory leaks when dissection fails. The semantics were slightly
    different though. When the DNS dissector tried to split the string "."
    using delimiter ".", it would previously (unexpectedly) receive an empty
    vector (and crash). Now it will receive a vector with one element.
    
    Additionally, suggest that users of wmem_strsplit with a NULL allocator
    use g_strsplit instead, otherwise it will leak the elements.

    Distinguish between "reserved for implementation" and "reserved for future use".
    
    Some flags in the connectionless PDU header are "reserved for
    implementation", which presumably means an implementation can set them
    to 0 or 1 and use it to send information to a compatible implementation;
    others are "reserved for future use" and "must be set to 0".
    
    Don't test the "reserved for implementation" flags in the heuristic, and
    show them as "Reserved for implementation" and show the others as
    "Reserved for future use (MBZ)".

        gui.filter_expressions.expr: tcp.flags.reset==1
        # note: missing label preference
        gui.filter_expressions.expr: dns
    
    While at it, do not duplicate the filter expression,
    "filter_expression_new" has always been copying it.

    BGP: Validate length of Path Attribute records.
    
    Bug 13741 showed a case where the BGP dissector's failure to validate the
    length of the Path Attribute record allowed a pathological BGP UPDATE packet to
    generate more than one million items in the protocol tree by repeatedly
    dissecting certain segments of the packet.
    
    It's easy enough to detect when the Path Attribute length cannot be valid, so
    let's do so.  When the condition arises, let's raise an Expert Info error in
    the same style and format as used elsewhere in the same routine, and abandon
    dissection of the Path Attributes list.
    
    With this check in place, an incorrect length computation is revealed at a
    callsite.  This would only have prevented a small (less than 5 bytes) Path
    Attribute from being dissected if it was at the very end of the Path Attributes
    list, but the bounds checking added in this change makes this problem much more
    apparent, so we fix the length computation while we're here.
    
    Testing Done: Built wireshark on Linux amd64.  Using bgp.pcap from the Sample
       Captures page on the wiki, verified that the dissection of the UPDATE
       packets were unaltered by this fix.  Using the capture attached to bug 13741
       (clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-6689222578667520.pcap), verified that the
       packet no longer triggers the "too many items" exception, instead we see
       an Expert Info for each oversized Path Attribute length, and eventually an
       exception for "length of contained item exceeds length of containing item".
       30,000 iterations of fuzz test with bgp.pcap as input, and many iterations
       of randpkt-test too.  Crafted a packet with a 3-byte ATOMIC_AGGREGATE Path
       Attribute at the end of the Path Attributes list; Before this change, an
       exception is raised during dissection, but after this change it is dissected
       correctly.

Date:   Sun Jun 17 18:39:36 2018 +0200

    HTTP: fix in desegmentation of HEAD requests and responses
    
    Previously HTTP message bodies following a HEAD request in the same conversation
    were not desegmented, resulting in spurious "Continuation" messages and failure
    to reassemble HTTP bodies. Fix this by properly taking the current HTTP message
    type (request or response) into account.

    Add some length checks, remove a DISSECTOR_ASSERT().
    
    Do more checks to make sure we don't run past the end of the data we're
    handed, and don't do a DISSECTOR_ASSERT(), as there may well be packets
    that don't have enough data to pass the assertion - that was causing
    some errors to show up in the 2.6 buildbot when doing 802.11 decryption
    tests.  Those errors should instead be reported as "sorry, we can't do
    decryption" errors by the decryption code.
    
    (XXX - the 802.11 *dissector* should probably be extracting the relevant
    fields and doing the relevant checks, and hand the data to the
    decryption code, so that we don't duplicate 802.11 frame parsing with
    code that might not do as much necessary work as the 802.11 dissector.)
    
    Tweak some comments while we're at it.

    Wiretap imposes an arbitrary limit on the maximum packet size, to

    running out of address space on ILP32 platforms or just eating too much

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Jun 12 10:47:36 2018 -0700

    Clean up handling of counted blobs of bytes.
    
    Don't treat the count+blob as itself a blob of bytes; use FT_NONE.
    Create it with an unknown length (-1, meaning "to end of packet, for
    now"), and set its length once we've finished dissecting it.  Dissect
    the raw bytes of a prefixed-bytes item regardless of whether we're
    building a protocol tree or not.
    
    This means we do a better job of handling a too-large length; instead of
    overflowing the offset, we throw an exception and stop dissecting, so we
    don't run the risk of looping infinitely.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Fri Jun 8 14:05:01 2018 -0700

    The string part of a NULL string is zero bytes long, not 4 bytes long.
    
    There aren't 4 bytes of 'N', 'U', 'L', and 'L' in the packet, so the
    length is *not* 4 bytes.

    Don't create fake string items.
    
    Have the item cover the part of the packet that has the issue, e.g. if
    there's an unexpected identifier, or an invalid length, cover that
    rather than the value; that 1) shows where the problem is and 2) avoids
    throwing an exception.
    
    Clean up the error messages and expert info items while we're at it.

    Correctly handle the PPI GPS timestamp fraction
    
    The timestamp and timestamp fraction are processed in one step,
    since this creates a proper timestamp interpretation. There are
    two fixes to this code to deal with erroneous packets.
    One is that when taking into account the timestamp fragment the
    available data must be 8 bytes in total, not just 4.
    The other is that when the mask indicates that there's only a
    timestamp fraction, nothing was shown.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Jun 3 10:13:20 2018 -0700

    Fix handling of guintvars.
    
    1) A value that fits in a 32-bit unsigned integer may take more than 4
    octets - the uppermost bit of the octet is a "more octets follows" flag,
    so 4 octets contain only 7*4 - 28 bits of value, so a fifth octet
    preceding that with the upper 3 bits zero could result in a value that
    fits in 32 bits, and further octets of 0x80 just add further leading
    zeroes.
    
    We should, instead, check for *overflow*, meaning that if we add more
    bits at the bottom, the result is *less* than the previous value.
    
    2) When the result overflows, we should clamp it a UINT_MAX, rather than
    setting it to zero, and should keep accumulating octets, so that we
    return the correct octet count.  That prevents infinite loops where the
    item's length, and the item itself, are considered zero-length.
    
    This should fix bug 14738.

    ber: clamp BER lengths to avoid integer overflow
    
    Many callers treat the length as signed integer, so ensure that the
    length fits in such a number. Failure to do so can have unintended
    consequences (such as calling "tvb_memdup(tvb, 0, -1)" and assuming that
    the length is actually 2^32-1).
    
    Although an exception could be thrown as well, let's give the caller a
    chance to handle this themselves.

    Don't check the CRC if the message isn't big enough to have a CRC.
    
    We should really do a better length check.  This also suggests that we
    might be going past the length if it's too short - should we create a
    new tvbuff, with tvb_subset_length(), and dissect based on that?

    ISMP: fix tuple decoding
    
    EDP_TUPLE_HOLD dissection was broken due to a length parameter mixup in
    v1.99.1rc0-224-g6720c80bab. The TLV length calculation was changed in
    commit ed5453d892, but the only pcap I could find for which it made a
    difference includes the TL lengths in the length field.
    
    Since commit 067a076179, the IPXNET type was wrongly decoded, fixed now.
    Check IPX address length to avoid a buffer overrun (read) in
    get_ether_name by at most 5 bytes.

Date:   Sun May 27 19:42:35 2018 -0700

    Make sure the offset doesn't overflow.
    
    It'd only overflow if the value is *so* large that it won't fit in the
    packet (given that we have a 2^32-1-byte limit on the packet size), so
    use tvb_ensure_bytes_exist() to ensure we have the entire value before
    processing the value.
    
    (The real problem is that we don't handle the case where there's a value
    multiplicity > 1 for some types; in those cases, we should loop,
    processing all the values, which would cause us to eventually throw an
    exception when we ran past the end of the packet.  This is just a quick
    fix.)

    Fix STUN-over-SSL/TLS/DTLS.
    
    Different dissectors are required for protocols running atop SSL/TLS and
    protocols running atop DTLS - SSL/TLS provides a byte-stream service, so
    there's no guarantee that there's a correspondence between SSL/TLS
    application data record boundaries and packet boundaries, but DTLS
    provides a datagram service, with packet boundaries corresponding to
    application data record boundaries.
    
    This is similar to the difference between dissectors for protocols
    running atop TCP and protocols running atop protocols such as UDP.
    
    So have two separate tables mapping Application-Layer Protocol
    Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs to dissector names - one for SSL/TLS and
    one for DTLS.
    
    There are both "over a byte-stream protocol" and "over a packet-oriented
    protocol" dissectors for STUN and TURN ChannelData packets.  Register
    the "over a byte-stream protocol" ones by name, and use the appropriate
    ones in the appropriate tables.  (There is not one named "stun", so the
    STUN dissector wouldn't have been called at all.)

    Do IP address resolution synchronously before printing in TShark.
    
    Otherwise, the first N packets printed, for a value of N dependent on
    various factors, won't get IP addresses resolved to names, even if the
    user wants them resolved.  Unlike Wireshark, which, when a name is
    resolved in asynchronously, can go back and fix up the displayed packet
    when the asynchronous operation completes, once TShark has written
    packet data to the standard output, it can't go back and fix it if it
    did name resolution asynchronously.
