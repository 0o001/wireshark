    LISP: Switch to proto_tree_add_subtree_format()
    
    When the LISP dissector was initially written, it followed a different
    pattern for adding subtrees with a text label, which needs to be
    modified while dissecting: proto_tree_add_item() +
    proto_item_append_text() + proto_item_add_subtree().
    
    This commit updates the code to use the more elegant
    proto_tree_add_subtree_format() call.

commit 2713dcbd21
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Nov 13 19:38:12 2018 -0800

    Catch attempts to write multiple encapsulation types if unsupported.
    
    If, in the process of opening the input file, we determine that it has
    packets of more than one link-layer type, we can catch attempts to write
    that file to a file of a format that doesn't support more than one
    link-layer type at the time we try to open the output file.
    
    If, however, we don't discover that the file has more than one
    link-layer type until we've already created the output file - for
    example, if we have a pcapng file with a new IDB, with a different
    link-layer type from previous IDBs, after packet blocks for the earlier
    interfces - we can't catch that until we try to write the packet.
    
    Currently, that causes the packet's data to be written out as is, so the
    output file claims it's of the file's link-layer type, causing programs
    reading the file to misdissect the packet.
    
    Report WTAP_ERR_ENCAP_PER_PACKET_UNSUPPORTED on the write attempt
    instead, and have a nicer error message for
    WTAP_ERR_ENCAP_PER_PACKET_UNSUPPORTED on a write.

Date:   Mon Nov 12 19:38:12 2018 -0800

    Fix dissection of 802.11+radiotap frames in Linux "cooked" captures.
    
    Those frames *don't* have their link-layer headers stripped, even on
    PF_PACKET/SOCK_DGRAM captures (hopefully, nobody will consider that a
    bug and "fix" it).
    
    The "hatype" field is the ARPHRD_ value for the adapter, as returned by
    SIOCGIFHWADDR; in monitor mode, those frames will have an hatype of
    ARPHRD_IEEE80211_RADIOTAP.  Add an "sll.hatype" dissector table, which
    we check before checking the "sll.ltype" dissector table, and have the
    radiotap dissector register in that table.
    
    We still use the special hack for an hatype of ARPHRD_NETLINK, because,
    for *those* frames, the "protocol" field of the nominal SLL header is
    the netlink family, not an Ethertype or anything else that the SLL
    dissector would handle.

    LBMPDM: fix heap-buffer-overflow (write) in dissect_segment_ofstable
    
    id_list and ofs_list contain offsets read directly from the packet.
    While the field type is FT_UINT32, it is somehow interpreted as signed
    number. This means that ofs_table->offset_list[id_list[idx]]=... could
    in fact result in an arbitrary write before "ofs_table->offset_list" due
    to id_list[idx] being negative.
    
    Another way for id_list[idx] to remain negative (-1) is for the loop to
    terminate before all "field_count" elements are set. Thus, remove the
    "datalen_remaining >= L_LBMPDM_OFFSET_ENTRY_T" check, if the offset is
    invalid the proto_tree_add_item accessors will throw an exception.
    
    Fixes the crash in the linked bug. Regression tested against the 8
    capture files from bug 9718, its dissection results are still the same.

    tvbuff_composite: fix buffer overflow due to wrong offset adjustment
    
    The tvb_offset method should return the offset of the buffer within the
    backing tvb (ds_tvb). The currently returned non-zero offset is valid
    for tvbuff_subset.c, but not for the composite TVB. The backing tvb is
    the tvb itself, so the offset should be zero (or "counter" for
    consistency with tvbuff_real.c and others).
    
    This bug is observable with the capture from the bug. In tshark, the
    data field in the PDML output has value "field length invalid!" and the
    position attribute ("pos") is too large. With the -V option it even
    crashes with a buffer overflow (read). In the GUI, the bytes tab shows
    range 3199-19642 even if the data source is only 16444 bytes while the
    selection should have been 0-16443.
