commit 3150650
Author: Jeff Morriss <jeff.morriss.ws@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 11 15:22:12 2014 -0500

    Fix SMPP timestamp decoding when the current date/time's offset to UTC is
    different from the timestamp's offset to UTC.
    
    The fix for bug 6712 ignored the fact that daylight savings will affect the
    offset from UTC--and whether daylight savings is in effect today might be
    different than whether it was in effect in the timestamp we're decoding.

    sigcomp-udvm: fix invalid access
    
    Way back in 2006, svn r20041 (now gd408f2f6fc) worked around a problem by
    limiting the amount of buffer dealt with in the udvm_state_access call (changing
    it from state_minimum_access_length_buff[n] to STATE_MIN_ACCESS_LEN).
    
    The very next line however, tries to read the same amount of buffer to display
    to the user - since it seems nobody ever applied a proper fix for the original
    case, just apply the same workaround to the second call.

    Use g_ascii_isalnum() rather than isalnum().
    
    Only *ASCII* alphanumerics are allowed in filterable field names, so use
    g_ascii_isalnum() to check for them.  That avoids issues with characters
    with the 8th bit set and avoids locale-dependent behavior.

      This "2nd try" is an attempt to prevent the Wireshark 1.12 fuzzbot
      from failing.
    
      As noted in the bug, a complete fix will require some reworking of
        the amqp dissector.

    Most of this was found by Boaz Brickner, but to prevent a few more bug reports, I tried to find any remaining MIPv6 options that used -1 to read until "end of packet" instead of "end of option"
    
    1. Option-Code and Reserved fields should be 1 byte, not 2 in Local Mobility Anchor Address mobility option
    2. IPv6 AUTH mobility option parses Mobility SPI
    3. IPv6 MESG-ID (should just be a timestamp field)
    4. IPv6 Redirect Mobility Option K and N bits are parsed incorrectly
    
    5. The following options had a field that read until the end of the packet instead of the end of the option:
    DNS-UPDATE-TYPE
    AUTH Authentication Data
    Care Of Test
    Permanent Home Keygen Token
    CGA Parameters

    ncp2222: initialize buffer in build_expert_data
    
    We do a bunch of conditional logic to fill in the buffer, and then were checking
    strlen(buffer) to see if we'd actually filled it in or not, but if we hadn't
    then the buffer was garbage and strlen(buffer) was throwing valgrind warnings.
    Ensure this works as intended by setting the first byte of the buffer
    unconditionally at the beginning, so strlen(buffer) returns 0 as expected in
    that case.

    IPv6: QuickStart option Nonce is read incorrectly
    
    In Wireshark, the option's TTL field looks ok, but the [TTL diff] field points to the byte after the TTL field, which is part of the nonce field.
    The nonce field is being read one byte after where it should be read and so the value being read is incorrect.
    Moreover, the option data length says 6 but because of the extra byte being read 7 bytes are being read for this option data and the next option is read one byte later incorrectly so the options after the QuickStart option are being read incorrectly.

    MIPv6: Mobility Option IPv6 Address/Prefix marks too many bytes for the address/prefix field
    
    One of the mobility options is the IPv6 Address/Prefix.
    The prefix length of this option is 52.
    Note that according to RFC 5568, the prefix length is in bits and not in bytes.
    The IPv6 Address/Prefix field of this option marks 52 bytes.
    
    In addition, I'm not sure that the IPv6 Address/Prefix field is a variable size field.
    RFC 5568 section 6.4.2 has a diagram of this options that shows this field as if it always takes 128 bits, and the prefix length field just says the length of the prefix (not the length of the field).

    Get rid of some no-longer-necessary casts.
    
    g_ascii_isXXX() can be handed a char value safely; they won't try to use
    it as an index into a table before checking it.

    Casting a signed char with a negative value to int will preserve the

    to make sure 0x80 through 0xFF are treated as 128 to 255, not -128 to

    Don't allocate the interfaces array until we've read the SHB.
    
    Nothing from the SHB gets stored in the interfaces array - it's filled
    in from IDBs - so it doesn't need to exist when we read the first SHB,
    and thus doesn't need to be freed if the attempt to read the SHB gets an

Date:   Tue Oct 14 16:53:03 2014 -0700

    We can't check the length of an SHB until we determine the byte order.
    
    Don't check a possibly-byte-swapped length against the minimum SHB size;
    it'll probably look huge if it's byte-swapped, so the test won't fail
    even if it is too small, and a really huge SHB's length could look too
    small if it's byte-swapped.
    
    Do the check *after* we've read the fixed-length portion of the block;
    yes, that means we've read past the purported size of the block at that
    point, but if that read succeeds, that doesn't matter, and if that read
    fails, it just means we'll report "file cut short" rather than "bad SHB
    length", *both* of which are problems with the file.

Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Thu Sep 25 12:09:23 2014 +0200

    cmake: use pkg-config for resolving dependencies
    
    Changes:
     * Fix glib2 search path.
     * Add pkg-config support to CAP, GEOIP, GNUTLS, LUA, PortAudio (API
       19), zlib, kerberos.
     * Add pkg-config support to libnl3, libnl2 and libnl1 (but tested only
       with libnl3).
    
    This makes it easier to do 32-bit builds on 64-bit hosts by just setting
    `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR`. Due to how HINTS work, it is still fragile though:
    missing 32-bit libraries will cause a fallback to 64-bit libraries.
    
    A future patch could check for `<PREFIX>_FOUND` and remove the manual
    `find_path` and `find_library` hackery since the paths are already
    known.

    cmake: update FindGTK2 to v3.0.1-1824-g0b12815
    
    Current FindGTK2.cmake as included with Wireshark cannot do a 32-bit
    build even after setting CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib32. After an update
    to upstream FindGTK2 (v3.0.1-1824-g0b12815), things build again.
    
    Compared to upstream FindGTK2, FindWSWinLibs and related hints have been
    added (note that "${GTK2_HINTS}/lib" is not a typo, it is needed as some
    headers are includes in locations like lib/gtk-2.0/include/). The
    include paths have become relative again as there are no files like
    FindPackageHandleStandardArgs in the Wireshark source tree. Diff between
    upstream FindGTK2 and the version in this patch:

    Set err_info if the attempts to read record headers fail.
    
    If it fails due to, for example, the file being gzipped and having a bad
    gzip CRC, the error returned is WTAP_ERR_DECOMPRESS and, for that error,
    err_info is expected to be set to a string giving details of the
    problem, so we need to pass back to our caller the string in question.

    Don't assert that values fit in 32 bits if the NDR64 flag is set.
    
    For now, this just pacifies fuzz-testing.  If real world examples have this, there needs to be a drastic overhaul to support fields that could be either 32 or 64-bit values.
