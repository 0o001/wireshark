Date:   Sun Mar 1 21:15:27 2015 -0500

    RTP player: don't crash when drawing channel graphs for very long calls.
    
    X11 can't handle pixmaps more than 32k pixels wide so don't try to feed it
    one.  This avoids crashes with the complaint "BadAlloc (insufficient
    resources for operation)".  Instead we simply truncate the graph (and tell the
    user).  Do this in a way that shows the user the empty portion of the graph.
    
    Hopefully the Qt port can fix this properly.
    
    Note: the bug report says that MacOS is not affected but it should be.  So
    apply this fix for all on-Windows systems.

commit 5db43d1
Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Sat Feb 14 15:36:09 2015 +0100

    Fix handling of invalid UAT items
    
    If the UAT file failed a field check, then the user_data pointer may be
    empty. As a result uat_save() triggers an invalid write.
    
    (Discovered while working with a dfilter_macros file having duplicate
    names for bug 10957, caught by ASAN.)
    
    The second issue fixed in this patch is that the validity of an item is
    only calculated when a new record is added. So even if the user edits
    the UAT and makes the entry valid, it would not be saved. This is solved
    by adding a new uat_update_record() function which got wires up into GTK
    and Qt.
    
    Some open-coded g_array_index and UAT[_USER]_INDEX_PTR are also
    converted.

    Don't base interpretation of LINKTYPE_ values on DLT_ value definitions.
    
    Instead, explicitly check for particular build platforms.  This means
    that the interpretation of the link-layer type values with different
    meanings on different platforms won't be dependent on the particular
    version of libpcap with which Wireshark happens to be built, and also
    means that we don't have to fix pcap-common.c to include pcap.h or

    According to RFC 5949 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5949#section-6.2.2), Option-Code=1 means IPv6 and Option-Code=2 means IPv4, exactly the opposite to what Wireshark does.

    Do bounds checking when decompressing WCP packets.
    
    Extract the data offset and count only once, and make sure we don't run
    past the end of the data we've copied from the packet; have
    decompressed_entry() just do the decompression, rather than also
    fetching the data offset and count.
    
    Add some comments while we're at it.
