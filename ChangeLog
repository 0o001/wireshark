Date:   Tue Oct 13 14:03:56 2015 -0700

    Update the new protocols list for 2.0
    
    Update the new protocols list based on diffing the output of `tshark -G
    protocols` from 1.12 and 2.0
    
    The "--sort-and-group--" macro does just that -- it sorts and
    comma-separates a list of items. Move sentences out of those blocks.

    Try to fix wireless toolbar behavior on Linux.
    
    Split interface get and set activity into explicit getInterfaceInfo and
    setInterfaceInfo member functions. Make sure we connect to QComboBox
    "activated" signals (which are only triggered by user activity)
    instead of "currentIndexChanged" signals (which are triggered on
    any change). Hopefully this will make the wireless toolbar read-only
    until the user selects a combobox item.

    Support in 6lowpan for RFC4944 address generation
    
    For the conversion of a 16-bit short address in 6lowpan to an IID, there
    are several RFCs that produce different results. RFC 4944 section 6
    specifies that the conversion uses the given PAN ID and the 16-bit short
    address. RFC 6282, on the other hand, specifies thta the conversion only
    uses the 16-bit short address and no longer uses the PAN ID.
    
    The current version of the 6lowpan dissector supports only the newer RFC
    6282, but there are protocols out there that assume that the address
    conversion still abides to RFC 4944.
    
    In order to support these protocols and following the discussion from
    
    https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=8970
    
    this patch introduces a boolean preference in the 6lowpan dissector that
    indicates whether or not the older RFC 4944 should be used for address
    conversion. By default, it is set to FALSE, thus leaving the behavior of
    the dissector unchanged.
    
    Besides the boolean preference, another helper function
    lowpan_addr16_with_panid_to_ifcid has been written that implements the
    expected behavior from RFC 4944 using the same hint mechanism already in

Date:   Fri Oct 9 11:48:35 2015 +0200

    Add WS_DLL_PUBLIC for Address Type Registration
    
    Dissectors developed as plugins in wireshark that create new address
    types require the use of address_type_dissector_register. Without
    WS_DLL_PUBLIC, the function is not found when loading the plugin and
    wireshark refuses to initialize it.
    
    This very simple patch fixes this problem.

    try both "python" and "python3" and just set $PYTHON to nothing if we

    AMQP: Fix usage of p_(add|get)_proto_data.
    
    The p_(add|get)_proto_data() functions are used to store data related

    multiple small AMQP frames in one TCP/IP packet.
    
    As suggested by Pascal and https://code.wireshark.org/review/#/c/10579/,
    we should use tvb_raw_offset as key for p_(add|get)_proto_data().

Date:   Sun Oct 4 11:22:41 2015 +0200

    ssl-utils: load RSA keys based on their modulus+exponent
    
    Load RSA private keys based on their public key instead of relying on
    the user to specify a valid address and port mapping. This is more
    reliable and prepares for simplification of the SSL Keys dialog.
    
    After this change, the "address" part of the UAT dialog will be ignored
    when loading the private key. The port+protocol mapping is still
    imported, but should probably be removed too.

commit 9d4080b
Author: Peter Wu <peter@lekensteyn.nl>
Date:   Sat Oct 3 19:23:55 2015 +0200

    ssl-utils: simplify private key storage, fix resource leaks
    
    The certificate and GnuTLS private key are never used except for
    reporting in the log file. Remove the unused certificate-related code
    from the PKCS#12 file parsing. Report an immediate error instead of
    opening key file if GnuTLS is disabled.
    
    Made ssl_load_key and ssl_load_pkcs12 static, they are not used outside
    the SSL dissector. If for some reason the PKCS#12 bag contains multiple
    private keys, then the previous one would be overwritten (leaking
    memory). Fix this by returning the first private key found.
    
    Simplify key_hash (dtls_key_hash/ssl_key_hash) memory management, now
    the table automatically frees keys/values when items are removed.
    
    Fix memory leaks:
     - ssldecrypt_uat_fld_password_chk_cb: release ssl_load_pkcs12 memory.
     - ssl_load_key: avoid leaking gnutls_x509_privkey_t on error.
     - ssl_load_pkcs12: fix ssl_pkey leak on error path.

    Enable -Wno-variadic-macros in configure.ac and CMakeLists.txt when
    -Wpedantic is enabled (which would enable -Wvariadic-macros).
    
    For all files matching 'define\s*\w+[0-9]\(', replace "FOO[0-9]" by
    "FOO" and adjust the macro definition accordingly. The nbap dissector
    was regenerated after adjusting its template and .cnf file. The
    generated code is the same since all files disabled the debug macros.

    This doesn't fix the issue entirely, e.g. if you're capturing in one

    case is to switch to QFileSystemWatcher as described at the top of

    wslua: fix crash when a LUA error is raised in TRY block
    
    The dissect_tcp_pdus function in LUA is passed two LUA functions that
    get the PDU length and the dissect a PDU. When one of these functions
    fail, a longjmp is made to the the caller of lua_pcall.
    
    This is no problem for the PDU length function, but the PDU dissect
    function is wrapped in a TRY/CATCH/ENDTRY block which also uses longjmp
    and need to be fully executed. Without doing so, LUA exceptions will
    crash on a weird location (except_pop).
    
    Fix the crash by not using luaL_error, but throw dissector errors which
    properly breaks out of the tcp_dissect_pdus C function and then convert
    it to a LUA error such that the dissector can handle it.
    
    Test with `tshark -X lua_script:crash.lua -r ssl.pcap`:
    
        trivial_proto = Proto("trivial", "Trivial Protocol")
        function dissect_foo(tvb, pinfo, tree)
            error("triggering a LUA error");
        end
        function get_pdu_len(tvb, pinfo, tree) return 5; end
        function trivial_proto.dissector(tvb, pinfo, tree)
            dissect_tcp_pdus(tvb, tree, 5, get_pdu_len, dissect_foo)
        end
        tcp_table = DissectorTable.get("tcp.port")
        tcp_table:add(443, trivial_proto)
    
    It should not crash and will print this:
    
        Lua Error: dissect_tcp_pdus dissect_func: [string "crash.lua"]:3: triggering a LUA error

commit a368ba5
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sat Oct 3 10:50:19 2015 -0700

    COMPOSE_FRAME_TYPE(fcf) is stored in frame_type_subtype.
    
    At that point, we've calculated COMPOSE_FRAME_TYPE(fcf) and stored it in
    frame_type_subtype; use that variable.

    Qt: Initial RTP playback.
    
    Note the "initial". This is woefully incomplete.  See the "to do" lists
    below and in the code.
    
    This differs a bit from the GTK+ version in that you specify one or more
    streams to be decoded.
    
    Instead of showing waveforms in individual widgets, add them all to a
    single QCustomPlot. This conserves screen real estate and lets us more
    easily take advantage of the QCP API. It also looks better IMHO.
    
    Change a bunch of checks for QtMultimediaWidgets to QtMultimedia. We
    probably won't use the widgets until we make 5.0 our minimum Qt
    version and plain old QtMultimedia lets us support Qt 4 more easily
    (in theory at least).
    
    Add resampling code from libspeex. I initially used this to resample
    each packet to match the preferred rate of our output device, but this
    resulted in poorer audio quality than expected. Leave it in and use to
    create visual samples for QCP and to match rates any time the rate
    changes. The latter is currently untested.
    
    Add some debugging macros.
    
    Note that both the RTP player and RTP analysis dialogs decode audio data
    using different code.
    
    Note that voip_calls_packet and voip_calls_init_tap appear to be dead
    code.
    
    To do:
    
    - Add silence frames where needed.
    - Implement the jitter buffer.
    - Implement the playback timing controls.
    - Tapping / scanning streams might be too slow.

    Treat IPv4 subnet masks as distinct from addresses
    
    While IPv4 subnet masks are obviously related and similar to IPv4
    addresses, they are distinct enough that they need to be treated
    seperately in some aspects.  For instance, there is no value in
    attempting to resolve a subnet mask.
    
    This change creates a new display type: BASE_NETMASK, which allows distinction from FT_IPv4
    (and possible name resolution) where appropriate.

    re-dissected. This results in a crash in GTK when the "RTP Analyse"
    option is used and and a crash in Qt when the display filter is changed
    while the RTP Streams dialog is open.
    
    Fix this by adding a tap_reset callback (modelled after mcaststream) to
    the RTP tap listener that allows the GTK+ and Qt dialogs to clear the
    displayed list of RTP streams.

    Add the conversation hash tables internals dialog.
    
    The GTK+ version dumps "new" and "old" hash values. It looks like
    neither are valid since the code in conversation.c and
    conversation_hashtables_dlg.c have diverged.
    
    For now just dump the addresses and ports for each hash table in the Qt
    UI.

    Fixes this failure:
    
        tshark: lapi.c:175: lua_settop: Assertion `(-(idx+1) <= (L->top - (func + 1))) && "invalid new top"' failed.
    
    Found using LUA 5.2 compiled with -DLUA_USE_APICHECK. Note that the
    value returned by luaopen_bit does not affect the size of the stack
    after using lua_call; if there are excess return values, then these will
    be dropped after calling lua_call. See http://www.lua.org/pil/26.2.html
    
    I also verified that the stack is still empty after calling all
    wslua_reg_module functions.

    gtk: Fix crash on Analyze RTP stream
    
    When updating the RTP streams list, the data associated with the current

    gtk_list_store_clear somehow triggers the selection callback which
    attempts to access the invalid memory.
    
    Avoid this by disabling selectability while clearing the list.

    Fix tests to allow selection of suite 10
    
    The tests only allowed a single character suite selection, which
    prevented suite 10 from being run on its own.
    
    Modified test.sh to now require a newline in addition to the input
    so that a 2 digit number can be entered.
    
    Also fixed test display to remove illusion that an individual step
    could be run.  Only whole suites can be run.

    Debian packages used to build with parallel build enabled when
    debian/rules used autotools but with switching to CMake the
    parallel build failed sometimes. Now the CMake based build
    system seems to be working for parallel builds, too, thus
    it seems to be safe to enable parallel building of .debs again.

    ui/gtk: fix weird check for axis orientation
    
    There is only one meaning for the flags parameter, namely axis
    orientation (x or y). Replace the bitmap by a bool instead.
    
    Clang 3.7.0 reported this warning:
    
        ui/gtk/tcp_graph.c:1652:29: warning: shifting a negative signed value is undefined [-Wshift-negative-value]
            g->y_axis->flags    &= ~AXIS_ORIENTATION;

        1 warning generated.
    
    This (~1 << 0) happened to work because nothing is actually shifted.

    CMake: Add a hardening-check target.
    
    On Windows, add a hardening-check target which checks for DYNAMICBASE
    and NXCOMPAT using the PowerShell script Get-HardenFlags.ps1.
    For a Visual Studio solution, run the check by calling:
    
        msbuild /m /p:Configuration=RelWithDebInfo hardening-check.vcxproj
    
    using the config as appropriate for your build.
    
    Otherwise if we find the Debian/Fedora hardening-check script add a
    target which runs it for each of our executables.

    Multiple SSL content in one packet fix
    
    When SSL packet contains multiple encrypted contents the WS shows only the
    last record due the wrong indexing of the structure where the decrypted

    offset as I think was intended.

    Refactor NCP Python data so that INFO column can be generated on the fly (TAKE 2)
    
    The "old" method of populating the INFO column was to dissect all fields of a function/subfunction, then do a search in the tree to find the hf_ values of interest to then format into something for the INFO column.  This is very expensive and requires "low level" APIs (for tree manipulation) which really shouldn't be used in a dissector.
    
    The "new" method populates the INFO column at the same time a field is parsed, so nothing has to be revisited (and allows for more fields to be displayed on some malformed packets).
    
    There are still expert infos (and possibly column APIs) under if (tree)s, but I'm not sure how FAKE_TREE_IS_VISIBLE factors into that.  Removing the FAKE_TREE_IS_VISIBLE seems to negatively affect dissection.

commit 30ff173
Author: Gerald Combs <gerald@wireshark.org>
Date:   Tue Sep 22 17:18:33 2015 -0700

    Qt: Always make the packet list row heights uniform.
    
    In tests here using GTK+ 2.24 and 3.10, GtkTreeView handles multi-line
    items by adjusting the height for all rows, but only after the number of
    multi-line items exceeds some sort of threshold. For a packet capture
    which contains a few DNS packets and a lot of TCP packets, if I change
    "Standard query" to "Standard\nquery" in packet-dns.c I get
    single-height packet list items. If I change "[TCP segment of a
    reassembled PDU]" to "[TCP segment of a\nreassembled PDU]" in
    packet-tcp.c (which results in more multi-line column strings) I get
    double-height packet list items.
    
    The current Qt code initially sets the uniformRowHeights property then
    falls back to variable row heights if we run across a multi-line column
    string. This adds a lot of logic which can impact other functionality
    (e.g. column widths) and recalculating row heights is painfully slow for
    large numbers of packets.
    
    Instead of trying to manage variable row heights, always enable
    uniformRowHeights. Track the maximum newline count and trigger a row
    height adjustment when it changes. This mimics the GTK+ UI behavior,
    although it should be more reliable.
    
    Note that we need to adjust some numbers in RelatedPacketDelegate.

    Qt: Add idle dissection.
    
    Features such as sorting and scroll bar colorization require
    fully-dissected packets. We currently do dissection at the wrong time --
    *after* the user clicks on a packet list column header or moves the
    scrollbar.
    
    Add a timer + slot that dissects packets when the UI is idle so that our
    packets are at least partially dissected when we need them.

Date:   Fri Sep 18 15:39:37 2015 -0400

    Refactor NCP Python data so that INFO column can be generated on the fly.
    
    The "old" method of populating the INFO column was to dissect all fields of a function/subfunction, then do a search in the tree to find the hf_ values of interest to then format into something for the INFO column.  This is very expensive and requires "low level" APIs (for tree manipulation) which really shouldn't be used in a dissector.
    
    The "new" method populates the INFO column at the same time a field is parsed, so nothing has to be revisited.
    
    There are still expert infos (and possibly column APIs) under if (tree)s, but with the FAKE_TREE_IS_VISIBLE "hacks" removed, there should be less fear in removing the tree checks.

    Including:
    1. Using ENC_BIG_ENDIAN and ENC_LITTLE_ENDIAN instead of self made macros
    
    2. Creating an "expert info hook" so that fields can be parsed "in real time" and added as expert info instead of searching by field name and manually getting values.  Most of the expert info is still under if (tree)s, but this is another step closer to removing all of the "manual labor" done that requires "special handling" of all tree functionality.  Once the "manual labor" is removed, this dissector can behave like every other dissector and the if (tree)s can be removed with more abandon.

    (In theory the UAT setting would work. In practice it would still call

    traffic. On removal with ssl_dissector_remove, the HTTPS port is not
    added back again until a restart (or until the HTTPS ports list is
    changed from the default) because the spdy registration overwrites the
    HTTP one...)
    
    Also note that NPN detection for SPDY is not implemented, only ALPN
    detection is supported.

    http2: fix dissection when using Upgrade
    
    The fix for bug 11331 has as side-effect that the HTTP part of a
    conversation is not dissected on the second pass.
    
    Fix it by calling the HTTP2 dissector only when it was detected via
    heuristics, and not via Upgrade (since that would be handled by the
    http loop).
    
    While at it, remove the use of tvb_new_subset_remaining since the
    original tvb is not touched and move the comment about the proxy to the
    right place.
    
    Tested with the capture from Alexis (plain HTTP2 via Upgrade), the one
    from bug 11331 (plain HTTP2 via heuristics) and a HTTP2 in SSL capture
    (via heuristics).

    Apply fix-encoding-args.pl "manually" and other cleanup.
    
    I'm guessing fix-encoding-args.pl doesn't work on packet-ncp2222.inc because the hf_ declarations/definitions aren't in the file itself, so it can't figure out endianness or field type.  So to bring the file up to modern coding standards, I did it "manually".  In general I think this file has escaped critique because of the "generated" nature of the dissector.
    
    Also removed tvb_ensure_bytes_exist and tvb_get_ptr use as both were superfluous.

    Squelch 64-bit-to-32-bit warnings by just casting to int.
    
    Those lengths had better fit in an int if they're added to packet offsets.
    
    (BTW, gsize is the spawn of Satan; it should never be used except when
    you're dealing with GLib.  It *should* have just been another name for
    size_t, but it's 32 bits on 64-bit Windows, which means it's narrower
    than size_t, which causes us some pain with g_snprintf().)

    Don't invalidate the column cache when we filter packets.
    
    Limit PacketListModel::recreateVisibleRows to checking for packets that
    passed the display filter. Remove the call to resetColumns, which
    invalidates the column string cache.
    
    Call PacketListModel::resetColumns from PacketList::columnsChanged.
    Along with invalidating the column string cache, this triggers a widget
    update which means we shouldn't need to call recreateVisibleRows or
    redrawVisiblePackets. Remove them.

    The value of the Avaya option 242 is a string containing a list of
    several suboptions seperated by a ",".
    However some suboptions may have multiple values also seperated by
    a comma. The values may be enclosed in quotes.
    
    A real-life string e.g. looks like:
    MCIPADD=10.1.1.2,10.1.1.3,TLSSRVR=10.1.1.5,VLANTEST=60,L2Q=1,L2QVLAN=77

    Bug fix of missing "RTP arrow" in the Flow graph of VoIP calls.
    
    This commit fixes bug that I have encountred in the Flow graphs of VoIP calls.
    Where the RTP communication is shown only in one direction. This happens
    because the packet-sip.c dissector is unable to find SIP/SDP setup frame from
    the recivers side and sets the setup frame to 0. Now if no frame is found the
    number of current frame is used. I have checked the previous versions and in
    ver 1.8.12 it worked properly (same as after this change).
    
    Note: I am not sure if the 1.8.12 is the last version where this was working
    properly.

    GTK displays "Waiting for capture input data" in the status bar until
    the capture file format is determined. After this patch, both versions
    will just display an "Interrupted system call" message.

    with -fPIC.  The preferred place to determine whether this is necessary
    is at configure time.  This change adds the auto-tool code to make that
    happen and removes the hack put in place as an interim solution.

    Don't use any -fsanitize options unless we're using ASAN.
    
    This lets cmake users configure without installing libusan.
    
    A better or more final fix awaits a decision in bug 11009.

    Move some stuff into the only code path where it's used.
    
    AirPDCapPacketProcess() really does two different things; some of the
    stuff it does in both code paths only needs to be done in one code path.
    Make it so.

    Add API to expose "expert info" summary.
    
    This is intended for use in expert_add_info_format or proto_tree_add_expert_format to get the "base" string to then append additional information, but I'm sure other uses can be found.
    Similar to some of the proto_get_xxx APIs, but still only "create as needed".

    Don't try to decrypt with an AES key shorter than 128 bits.
    
    AES keys must be at least 128 bits; AES_unwrap returns a null pointer if
    handed a too-short key, and we then just dereference that null pointer
    and crash.  Just give up with a too-short key.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Sep 7 16:44:56 2015 -0700

    Add a new expert info type for decryption problems.
    
    This is what should be used if, for some reason, decryption can't be
    performed.  (And if there's a known reason why decryption can't be
    performed, it should be used, so the user knows why their
    802.11/SSL/whatever traffic isn't decrypted, and either doesn't have to
    ask why or, at least, can give more details when they do ask why.)
    
    (Yes, I plan to use this for the 802.11 decryption code.  Work in
    progress.)

    SSL: bugfix for raw public keys in certificate message
    
    RFC 7250 has changed the format of the Certificate structure from
    RFC 5246 to the following:
    
    opaque ASN.1Cert<1..2^24-1>;
    
    struct {
        select(certificate_type) {
    
            // certificate type defined in RFC 7250
            case RawPublicKey:
               opaque ASN.1_subjectPublicKeyInfo<1..2^24-1>;
    
            // X.509 certificate defined in RFC 5246
            case X.509:
               ASN.1Cert certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;
        };
    } Certificate;
    
    Thus, ssl_dissect_hnd_cert() must parse subjectPublicKeyInfo
    immediately when the message's certificate type is
    SSL_HND_CERT_TYPE_RAW_PUBLIC_KEY. Otherwise, the message will
    contain a certificate_list.
    
    This modification first determines the certificate type and then
    handles both cases independently. For raw public keys, no subtree
    is created to reflect the flat structure of the certificate
    message.

    Insert correct padding in RFC 6282 IPHC headers
    
    IPv6 Extension Headers compressed using IPHC should have a single Pad1
    or PadN inserted at the end if necessary - the previous code just left
    any padding zero-initialised (equivalent to multiple Pad1s).
    
    This guarantees correctly-compressed packets are accurately
    decompressed, including the specific option padding pattern. (The type of
    padding could matter, eg for IPSec authentication - padding options are
    authenticated.)
    
    Print a warning note if a non-option header needs padding - this is
    invalid.

    GTK packet list string chunk fixups.
    
    Call g_string_chunk_clear when we clear the packet list. Allocate 1 MiB
    chunks instead of 32 byte chunks. This doesn't do much in practice locally
    but appears more correct according to the GStringChunk documentation
    and source code.

    Remove the GTK+ IAX2 analysis circuit check.
    
    The IAX2 dissector stopped setting pinfo->circuit_id last October in
    g3d359da. Remove the corresponding check from the IAX2 Analysis dialog,
    otherwise it won't open.

    Address "shadow" warnings found by checkAPI script.
    
    These aren't "true" shadow issues, but the script doesn't completely understand C syntax (for things like struct member names "time" and "index").  But fixing them creates less noise.

commit 32e785f
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Wed Sep 2 14:35:37 2015 -0700

    The official #define for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows is _WIN32.
    
    It's _WIN32, with a leading underscore, not WIN32.  See, for example:
    
        https://sourceforge.net/p/predef/wiki/OperatingSystems/
    
    and
    
        https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b0084kay.aspx
    
    *Some* environments may also define WIN32, but we shouldn't depend on
    that.
    
    Replace all-caps "WIN32" referring to Windows in comments and other text
    with "Windows" or "Win32".  (The two are pretty much equivalent, these
    days; nobody much cares about Win16, not that we ever ran on it, and
    64-bit Windows is just a 64-bitified Win32.)
