    ICMPv6: Fix data length for unknown option
    
    The length value includes the Type and Length fields. Therefore the
    length of the Data field is two bytes smaller.

    TCP Analysis: Update the spurious retransmission check.
    
    The spurious retransmission check operates on the last-seen
    acknowledgment in the reverse direction. Adjust the analysis logic so
    that it is checked independently of the forward sequence number.
    
    Update the documentation accordingly.

    Qt: Main Welcome behavior tweaks.
    
    Update the recent item list and interface tree style sheets so that
    hovered items have a different background color. This should make it
    more obvious that they can be clicked.
    
    Select the default interface (or failing that, the first interface) at
    application startup and focus on the interface tree. This should make it
    less likely that the user will start typing in a capture filter with the
    wrong (or no) interface selected.  Note that we should probably track
    selected interfaces in the recent file instead of forcing the user to
    select one via the preferences.
    
    This should hopefully address some of the issues in bug 12636 and do so
    without changing the layout (which we can do in another commit).

    ERF_TYPE_META write and comment support
    
    Support per-packet comments in ERF_TYPE_META through a new Anchor ID
    extension header with per-Host unique 48-bit Anchor ID which links an
    ERF_TYPE_META record with a packet record. There may be more than one
    Anchor ID associated with a packet, where they are grouped by Host ID
    extension header in the extension header list. Like other ERF_TYPE_META
    existing comments should not be overwritten and instead a new record
    generated. See erf_write_anchor_meta_update_phdr() for detailed comments
    on the extension header stack required.
    
    As Wireshark only supports one comment currently, use the one one with
    the latest metadata generation time (gen_time). Do this for capture
    comment too.
    
    Write various wtap metadata in periodic per-second ERF_TYPE_META records
    if non-WTAP_ENCAP_ERF or we have an updated capture comment.
    Refactor erf_dump to create fake ERF header first then follow common
    pseudoheadr and payload write code rather than two separate code paths.
    Support an ERF_HOST_ID environment variable to define Wireshark's Host
    ID when writing. Defaults to 0 for now.
    
    ERF dissector updates to support Anchor ID extension header with basic
    frame linking.
    Update ERF_TYPE_META naming and descriptions to official name
    (Provenance)
    
    Core changes:
    Add has_comment_changed to wtap_pkthdr, TRUE when a packet
    opt_comment has unsaved changes by the user.
    Add needs_reload to wtap_dumper which forces a full reload of the file
    on save, otherwise wireshark gets confused by additional packets being
    written.

    The default QTreeView/QTreeWidget behavior for (Shift-)Tab navigation is
    to select the previous/next row. For data entries with multiple columns
    (such as the UAT dialog or the coloring rules dialog), column
    navigation is closer to what a user would expect, so implement that.

    ssl,dtls: make some fields in RSA keys dialog optional
    
    The IP address has been unused since 2.0. The port/protocol fields have
    become unnecessary since 2.4 with the introduction of Decode As. Do not
    require the user to specify these fields if they just want to set the
    RSA key file.
    
    In a future version, these three fields will be completely removed.

    Qt: Set IO Graph display filter when having Y field
    
    Calling setFilter() between setValueUnits() and setValueUnitField()
    will fail when having "Y Field" because check_field_unit() fails
    with inconsistent values.  The display filter will then be ignored.
    
    Call setFilter() first to ensure filter_ is set before setting
    value units.  setFilter() does not depend on the value unit when
    used to set the display filter.

    iface_lists: select interfaces via command line (option -i)
    
    The "wireshark -i lo" option somehow did not mark interfaces as
    selected. It turns out that the "-i" option populates the "ifaces"
    array during option parsing, but we must also set the "selected"
    property in the "all_ifaces" array in function "scan_local_interfaces".

    dumpcap: fix buffer overflow on packets larger than 2048 bytes
    
    When the current capture buffer is too small, it must be increased
    before attempting to read the next data packet.
    
    Fix developed by Mikael Kanstrup (and Guy), I added comments such that
    the next reader does not have to guess whether "incl_len" is
    accidentally used for reading from the buffer (it is not).

    Qt: fix alloc-dealloc-mismatch while adding named pipe
    
    ManageInterfacesDialog::on_addPipe_clicked uses g_new0 to create an
    "interface_t" instance, but InterfaceTreeCacheModel uses qDeleteAll
    which results in ASAN reporting "alloc-dealloc-mismatch (malloc vs
    operator delete)".
    
    To fix this, remove the dynamic allocation and make
    InterfaceTreeCacheModel store the instance internally.
