    GSM/SMS: clarify 'no error' values of TP-Status IE
    
    In case of successfull delivery, TP-Status IE looks as follows:
    
      TP-Status
          0... .... = Definition of bits 0-6: as follows
          .00. .... = Error: Short message transaction completed (0)
          ...0 0000 = Reason: Short message received by the SME (0)
    
    in particular, "Error: Short message transaction completed" looks
    confusing. Let's make it a bit cleaner:
    
      TP-Status
          0... .... = Definition of bits 0-6: as follows
          .00. .... = Error: No error, short message transaction completed (0)
          ...0 0000 = Reason: Short message received by the SME (0)

commit 3fb118e58c
Author: Vadim Yanitskiy <axilirator@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 13 22:47:10 2020 +0700

    GSM/SMS: decouple error and reason fields in TP-Status IE
    
    According to 3GPP TS 23.040, section 9.2.3.15, the TP-Status IE
    indicates the status of a previously submitted SMS-SUBMIT and
    certain SMS COMMANDS for which a Status-Report has been requested.
    
    Currently Wireshark dissects this IE as follows:
    
      TP-Status
          0... .... = Definition of bits 0-6: as follows
          .000 0000 = Error: Short message transaction completed (0)
          .000 0000 = Reason: Short message received by the SME (0)
    
    so it's not clear how exactly both Error and Reason are derived
    from 7 less-significant bits of the first (and the last) octet.
    
    As can be seen from the section 9.2.3.15, two less-significant
    bits of those 7 define the Error, while the remaining 5 bits
    define the Reason.
    
    With this change applied, dissected TP-Status IE looks as follows:
    
      TP-Status
          0... .... = Definition of bits 0-6: as follows
          .00. .... = Error: Short message transaction completed (0)
          ...0 0000 = Reason: Short message received by the SME (0)
    
    To achieve this, type of the 'dis_field_st_error_rvals' was changed
    from 'range_string' to 'value_string', and the range / string array
    'dis_field_st_reason_rvals' was split into 4 arrays corresponding
    to 4 possible Error values.

    MIME/pcapng: use snap length to get SPB data length
    
    The "Original Packet Length" field of a Simple Packet Block can be
    greater than the amount of data actually captured; the Interface
    Description Block's snap length must be checked as well.
    
    To enable this in the MIME Files Format dissector, the
    `interface_description` needs to store the snap length. This allows the
    appropriate section of `dissect_block()` to access it via the `info`
    parameter.
    
    The "Captured Length" field from EPB/PB dissection is added to SPB
    dissection as a generated field to clarify the difference between it and
    the field labelled "Packet Length".

    is at least one implementation that requires it.)
    
    For various structures with a length field, create the top-level tree
    field for the item with a "run to the end of the packet" length and,
    once we're finished dissecting it, set the length to its actual value.
    
    Fetch various field values using proto_tree_item_add_uint.  Fix some
    incorrect field types based on errors reported by that.
    
    If an end-of-options option has a non-zero length, 1) don't treat it as
    not an end-of-options option and 2) report an error on its length.

    pcapng: expert info when packet or ISB appear without interfaces
    
    A valid pcapng file must have an IDB before any EPB/SPB/PB/ISB. So check
    our interface count when we parse the first such block of a section, and
    add expert info if there are no interfaces.
    
    Discovered during work on Bug #16526.

Date:   Sun May 3 13:04:49 2020 -0700

    Clean up some issues with get_iface_list_string().
    
    Remove an assignment of NULL to a variable when it's in a branch of code
    where the variable's already known to be NULL.  Found by PVS-Studio.
    
    Pull get_display_name_for_interface() into the one place it's used.
    That:
    
        allows us to eliminate a test as, inside the loop where it's called,
        the loop index is what's passed to it, and the loop tests whether
        it's in range, so the test will never fail;
    
        means we just set interface_opts once, for both of the places it's
        used.
    
    Then we fix that code so that it sets interface_opts->descr to a
    generated descriptive name if it *is* null, rather than if it's *not*
    null.
    
    That should clean up some issues found by 1) PVS-Studio and 2) me.

    pcapng: show some fields in decimal, not hexadecimal.
    
    The interface ID is just an ordinal; there's no reason to show it as hex
    (we don't show it as hex if we're treating a pcapng file as a capture
    rather than a file to be dissected).
    
    The packet drops count is just a count, so, again, there's no reason to
    show it as hex.
    
    The hash algorithms numbers are given in decimal in the pcapng spec, so
    display it as decimal.

commit a3a8aa0fa5
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Apr 12 14:55:52 2020 -0700

    Add record length checks.
    
    Make sure the summary record is large enough; if not, report it as a bad
    file.
    
    If it's *too* large, skip the added data.
    
    Clean up the length check for the header records - use sizeof, as we
    later use sizeof when subtracting the fixed length portion's length.

    Fix previous change.
    
    Get rid of leftover duplicate code setting up the wtap structure and
    private data before we've found a summary record.
    
    If we find no data records, break out of the loop, so we fall into the
    code that sets up the wtap structure and private data.

commit 2e6b6865b6
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sat Apr 11 20:43:09 2020 -0700

    Fix the heuristic for checking whether it's a CAM Inspector file.
    
    wtap_read_bytes() returns TRUE on *success*, so if we're in the loop,
    the last read succeeded, and no error code was supplied.  When we *exit*
    the loop, the read didn't succeed; check for the status then.  If we got
    a short read, we ran out of file data, so check the heuristics (even if
    it's not an integral number of 2-byte blocks, treat it as a CAM
    Inspector file - it might have gotten cut short); if we got a real read
    error, report that to our caller.

    If it has none, we don't know what link-layer header type it has, nor do
