Date:   Sat Sep 12 06:23:47 2020 +0000

    ncp: fix a copy-and-pasteo.
    
    In process_multivalues(), we create a protocol item for the attribute
    syntax, but we don't fetch its value, and don't pass it to
    print_nds_values() as the syntax argument; instead, we pass a variable
    that wee initialize to 0, but never set.  (One of the disadvantages of
    preemptively initializing local variables is that data flow analyzers in
    compilers and static analyzers can't point out that you didn't set the
    variables in question to *useful* values.)
    
    This fixes the dissection of NDS Read replies.

    Q.933: Fix decoding of PVC Status field
    
    This field is actually a bitmask of four bits.  It's somewhat odd
    to decode it using a value_string.  In any case, the values were
    plain wrong (shifted to the left by '1').

    The mask applied to the final octet of the PVC Status IE must be 0x0E,

    instead of it.

    TCP: do not use an unknown status when the checksum is 0xffff
    
    Otherwise it triggers an assert when adding the column as the field is
    defined as BASE_NONE and not BASE_DEC or BASE_HEX. Thus an unknown value
    (not in proto_checksum_vals[)array) cannot be represented.
    Mark the checksum as bad even if we process the packet.
