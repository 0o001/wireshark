Author: Sake Blok <sake@euronet.nl>
Date:   Thu May 30 13:11:21 2019 +0200

    IP: Make dissection of ip.frag_offset RFC 791 compliant
    
    The v2.5.0rc0-478-g558fe23226, the dissection of ip.frag_offset changed
    to be listed under "Flags", this is not correct. The Fragmentation
    Offset is a separate field according to the RFC. This change corrects
    that behavior. Also, the raw value from the header was shown instead of
    the real byte offset, this is also corrected.

    wslua: Improve parameter check in ProtoField.new()
    
    Improve paremeter check in ProtoField.new() when using ftypes.CHAR:
    - Check valid base types and give an error when not supported instead of
      terminate in a g_error() (base.DEC is not supported).
    - Give an error if used with base.UNIT_STRING instead of silently remove
      the flags.
    
    Support using base.NONE with a valuestring.
    Add ftypes.CHAR to the list of supported types.

    Fix checks for "do we have an ERSPAN header?"
    
    For a GRE protocol type of 0x008E, check the "sequence number present"
    bit in the GRE header, if it's available, to see if the packet has an
    ERSPAN header or not, rather than checking the entire header to see if
    it's zero.  (If the GRE header isn't available, assume no ERSPAN
    header.)
    
    For a GRE protocol type of 0x22EB, always treat the packet as having an
    ERSPAN header.
    
    That matches more closely what the most recent I-D for ERSPAN said.

    Show the value symbolically, and don't dissect the payload as an
    Ethernet packet if the value isn't 0, meaning "Ethernet".
    
    This gets rid of the mis-dissection of the payload in the capture
    atttached to bug 16089, although it doesn't dissect it any further, as
    we don't know how to dissect it.
