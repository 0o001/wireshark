    autotools: really disable warnings by default
    
    The v2.2.0rc1 release tarball accidentally enables warnings as errors,
    this led to build failures due to warnings that occur on 32-bit builds.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Aug 30 17:59:59 2016 -0700

    Use "ecatf" as the protocol name, to parallel everything else.
    
    The fields have names beginning with "ecatf.", the dissector is called
    "ecatf", and it's only the frame layer of EtherCAT anyway, so just call
    it "ecatf".

commit 6b6cf99
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Aug 30 15:51:54 2016 -0700

    Don't do any Decode As stuff for dissector tables not used with Decode As.
    
    Have all dissector tables have a "supports Decode As" flag, which
    defaults to FALSE, and which is set to TRUE if a register_decode_as()
    refers to it.
    
    When adding a dissector to a dissector table with a given key, only add
    it for Decode As if the dissector table supports it.
    
    For non-FT_STRING dissector tables, always check for multiple entries
    for the same protocol with different dissectors, and report an error if
    we found them.
    
    This means there's no need for the creator of a dissector table to
    specify whether duplicates of that sort should be allowed - we always do
    the check when registering something for "Decode As" (in a non-FT_STRING
    dissector table), and just don't bother registering anything for "Decode
    As" if the dissector table doesn't support "Decode As", so there's no
    check done for those dissector tables.

    isakmp Fix IKEv2 modification UAT crash
    
    Problem is that not all fields of UAT are updated on change (only those
    defined in UAT definition with ikev2_uat_flds, specifically pointers to
    encr_spec and auth_spec in ike2_decr_data_t were set to NULL.
    
    Fixed by re-setting pointers after update table callback was called.
    
    Also fixed memory leaks after UAT modification.
    
    Bug was partially resolved with change
    Ibdab979b5959eb561635cbcb446e17138baca87b
    https://code.wireshark.org/review/17078
    
    which eliminated crash, but decryption still didn't work after UAT
    modification (DISSECTOR BUG was displayed).

    Handle quoted-pairs in quoted-strings correctly.
    
    Backslash, in a quoted-string, escapes quotes (and any other characters,
    although the only ones that *need* escaping are a double-quote and a
    backslash).
    
    This means that the value of a parameter isn't just the raw characters
    from the parameters string; for a quoted string, it needs to be
    un-escaped, and for a *non*-quoted string, it has to stop at the first
    non-token character (you can put comments in).  So
    ws_find_media_type_parameter() must return an allocated string with the
    actual value.
    
    Get rid of index_of_char(); it doesn't do anything that strchr() does.
