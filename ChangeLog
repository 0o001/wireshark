    nfs: fix failure to parse EXCHANGE_ID arguments
    
    The exchange_id spo_must_enforce/spo_must_allow bitmaps are exceeding
    this arbitrary MAX_BITMAPS constant, causing EXCHANGE_ID parsing to
    fail.
    
    Even in the case of attributes we may need more than 4 words soon, even
    if we don't I'm not sure if it's actually illegal to zero-pad them out
    to something longer, and even if that is illegal I don't think it's
    really helpful of wireshark to stop parsing.
    
    Keep the constant just as a sanity check but make it really large.

    Qt: Update and rename the summary dialog.
    
    Go back to a single view similar to the GTK+ UI. Apply layouts using Qt
    Designer.
    
    Rename the menu item and class to "Capture File Properties". It's not
    really a summary if it contains details such as "marked average bits
    per second". We might want to move this to a "Properties" item under
    the "File" menu similar to other applications.
    
    Add the GTK+ summary icon (for now) to the toolbar and open the
    properties dialog on clicking.
    
    Singleton dialogs delenda est[1]. Let the user open as many summaries on
    as many capture files as he or she wishes. Also, global cfile delenda
    est[2].
    
    Don't blindly include QtGui. Add specific components instead.
    
    Use consistent method names, variable names, and patterns. Try to
    document what "consistent" means.
    
    Adjust the way we display some statistics to match the summary bar, e.g.
    displayed = captured if we don't have a filter applied.
    
    [1] Not really.
    [2] Yes, really.

    Don't put bitmasks under an FT_NONE.
    
    proto_tree_add_bitmask() requires that the field under which it's
    putting the bitmasks be an FT_INTn or FT_UINTn, so that it can determine
    the length of the field.
    
    Arguably, proto_tree_add_bitmask() should, instead, take a length
    argument, just as other proto_tree_add_ routines do, and, arguably, we
    should perhaps not even have FT_UINTn and FT_INTn, just FT_UINT and
    FT_INT, with the display width for hex and octal (leading zeroes)
    determined by the actual length of the field or something such as that,
    or as part of the field that also contains the base.
    
    But, even with that, we might want to require an FT_UINTn or FT_INTn
    anyway, at least in cases where the value of the field as a whole is
    interesting.

Date:   Thu Nov 27 15:09:52 2014 +0100

    Fix showing error dialog when calling vsimple_error_message_box()
    
    SimpleDialog requires a parent, when none is provided (as there is no parent available during startup), the error message is queued and displayed after MainWindow is available.
    Calling SimpleDialog::exec() directly returns if no parent is set (hence the dialog is not shown)
    
    This resulted in silently ignoring error messages that were shown using vsimple_error_message_box(), as this function did not provide a parent (and the queue messages were not dequeued anymore as the MainWindow was already available)

    The packet encapsulation is in pkt_encap, not rec_type.
    
    rec_type is the type of record (which isn't necessarily a packet; future
    work on libwiretap will let it return non-packet data); if it's a packet
    (REC_TYPE_PACKET), then pkt_encap contains the "link-layer"
    encapsulation for the packet (in quotes because it may contain metadata
    not transmitted over the network).

    Squelch some "can't happen in reality" warnings.
    
    (I guess newer versions of GCC/Clang know that dissect_eh_frame() is
    never called with a segment_size of 0, so the loop is traversed at least
    once.  NOTE: if it ever *is* called with a segment_size of 0, then
    that's a genuine bug and needs to be fixed.)
    
    Also, segment_size is used; no need to mark it as unused.

    elf: fix .eh_frame parsing, add expert info for bad CIE length
    
    Fixes, matching LSB 4.1[1] and the AMD64 ABI[2]:
     - Multiple CIE entries can exist after the first one. Introduce a CFI
       subtree and add CIE and FDE records below it. Merge comon parsing
       functionality of CIE/FDE. A CIE terminator is treated specially, and
       added instead of a CFI subtree.
     - Validate the header length before using it to avoid a dissector
       assert. This condition is triggered by a binary produced by a buggy
       gold linker[3].
     - Add two expert items: one to detect an invalid CIE length (too small
       or too large) and one to detect a segment which is larger than the
       CFI records (to catch the gold linker bug[3] where the segment begins
       with zeroes).
     - Do not overload the elf.eh_frame.length field with the value of the
       Extended Length, instead use elf.eh_frame.extended_length (likewise
       for FDE).
     - Stop tracking the subsection size with another variable
       (remaining_length), just store the end of the entry.
     - Fix typos in descriptions, improved / shortened field descriptions.
    
    Tested with the 'bad' and 'good' binary from bug 10726 as well as the
    'a' binary from bug 8818 (which introduced this code). Decodes properly.

     - Rename various "alljoyn.header..." display filter

        to "alljoyn.mess_header..." to distinguish
        the fields from actual alljoyn "header" fields.
        This also fixes the duplicate use of the display

    qt: fix use-after-free pattern
    
    qstring.toUtf8() returns a QByteArray object and .constData() returns
    a pointer inside that object. It is not safe to store this pointer as
    it will become invalid after the statement. Store a const reference
    instead. (Due to scoping differences, some are copy-assigned though.)
    
    In the UAT dialog, strlen(bytes.constData()) has also been replaced by
    bytes.size() as an optimization.

    Clean up routine names, don't pass capture_file into libwireshark.
    
    Give all routines in epan/print.c that write a particular format a name
    beginning with write_{formatname}.
    
    If routines write columns, rather than the raw protocol tree, don't give
    it a name containing proto_tree.
    
    Get rid of empty preamble/finale routines.
    
    For CSV, the preamble routine writes out column titles, so call it
    write_csv_column_titles().
    
    For C arrays, the body routine writes out raw hex data, so call it
    write_carrays_hex_data().
    
    capture_file isn't a structure defined by libwireshark, so don't make it
    an argument passed into libwireshark.

    Make the ENTTEC dissector reject packets that don't look like ENTTEC packets.
    
    This should avoid questions like
    
    	https://ask.wireshark.org/questions/38198/what-is-enttec-in-a-pcap-file
    
    It also splits DMX-over-UDP and DMX-over-TCP into separate dissectors,
    as
    
    	1) DMX-over-TCP has only config packets, DMX-over-UDP has the
    	   others;
    
    	2) that would let us do reassembly, if necessary, for
    	   DMX-over-TCP.

    Don't cast a pointer-to-int into a pointer-to-pointer and pass the
    resulting pointer to g_hash_table_lookup_extended() - pointers and ints
    are *not* guaranteed to be the same size.  Instead, just have a variable
    of type gpointer, pass a pointer to *that*, and then run that result

commit 534b596
Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Sun Nov 16 10:22:34 2014 -0500

    Cleanup packet-sccp.c in preparation of trying to remove sccp_info member of packet_info.
    
    Convert a handful of global variables into function parameters that get passed through the dissector, so we shouldn't be dependent on pinfo->sccp_info anymore. Removal of pinfo->sccp_info will be done in a separate patch (when the dissectors that use it can be updated).
    
    packet-sua.c may need similar treatment.

    Fix problem where the profile bar moves further left every time Wireshark is
    run.
    
    For the saved/restored geometry to be consistently correct we need to always
    show the expert info and capture file comment icons.  Disable them if no
    capture file is open.

commit d7e277a
Author: Michael Mann <mmann78@netscape.net>
Date:   Fri Nov 21 10:43:40 2014 -0500

    CANopen bugfixes
    
    1. Fixed endianess in CANopen dissector.
    According to CiA 301, 7.1.1. (p. 26):
    "For numerical data types the encoding is little endian style."
    
    2. Fixed NMT type string in CANopen dissector
    NMT function code should not display 'EMERGENCY'
    
    3. Fixed time stamp decoding
    
    * Offset increment was too low for data type size
    * Decoding of time_stamp_days must equal time_stamp_msec and thus be letohs instead of ntohs. CANopen data is little-endian encoded.
    
    4. Fix: Use correct description string for NMT error control state bits
    canopen.nmt_guard.state was faulty named "Node-ID". This was changed to "State".
    
    5. Fix nmt_guard_state value_string array
    CiA 301 desribes only 4 valid values. All other were deleted.
    0x00 was renamed from 'Initalisation' to 'Boot-up' following CiA301.
    
    6. Shortened EMERGENCY to EMCY
    
    The term EMCY is the standard abbreviation used in CiA standard for Emergency service.
    
    7. Fix: Allow SYNC and NMT error frames without any payload
    NMT node guard remote requests do note have a payload,
    SYNC frames only have an optional payload (counter)
    
    If item length is set to -1, decode will cause a 'Malformed Packet' error.
    
    8.  Rename MT_NMT_GUARD to MT_NMT_ERR_CTRL which better reflects its scope

    If it doesn't end with a comma, then, if you don't provide any

Date:   Mon Nov 10 14:24:18 2014 -0600

    Allow building under OSX Yosemite using cmake.
    
    CFPropertyListCreateFromStream() has been deprecated in Yosemite, in favor of CFPropertyListCreateWithStream(). The autotools
    build checks for the existence of the new function, but the cmake build does not. So, add a check for it to CMakeLists.txt, and
    update cmakeconfig.h.in to provide the "template" for HAVE_CFPROPERTYLISTCREATEWITHSTREAM.
    
    Change-Id: I1a4e3e1ce83092ecf7725527b921eeca80b18d4b
    Note: CFPropertyListCreateWithStream() works under Mavericks as well.

    USB: consider the device class when we try to select the next dissector
    
    at the moment, we only use the interface class, even in situations where
    it's not applicable (e.g. control request that's not addressed to an
    interface or an endpoint) - this is a hack that works because some
    dissectors register for interface class "unknown", I'm trying to make
    this workaround obsolete

    Improved deregistering fields.
    
    This improvement avoids use of deallocated memory (crash) if using a
    deregistered field in display filter, color filter, custom column and
    other cases when the field is used as "interesting field".
    
    This functionality is currently used in http, imf and ldap preferences.
    
    Also removed unused proto_registrar_n() as this does not work correctly
    after deregistering fields.

    When the class is not matching, the error message shows the given and expected tags which are the same, confusing the user what is wrong with it.
    
    Furthermore, the messages for SEQUENCE and SEQUENCE OF are made the same/similar.

    sigcomp-udvm: fix invalid access
    
    Way back in 2006, svn r20041 (now gd408f2f6fc) worked around a problem by
    limiting the amount of buffer dealt with in the udvm_state_access call (changing
    it from state_minimum_access_length_buff[n] to STATE_MIN_ACCESS_LEN).
    
    The very next line however, tries to read the same amount of buffer to display
    to the user - since it seems nobody ever applied a proper fix for the original
    case, just apply the same workaround to the second call.

commit 78492d9
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Nov 4 17:49:29 2014 -0800

    Cope with newer Xcode not having the 10.6 SDK.
    
    The latest Xcode, as of today, has only 10.9 and 10.10 SDKs, which means
    that, if we build Wireshark and request a deployment minimum release of
    10.6, we'll be building against an SDK in which libpcap has routines
    that aren't available in 10.6 and that doesn't use weak linking for
    them, so the resulting binary won't actually work on 10.6.
    
    Use the run-time loader to find those routines (currently, only
    pcap_set_tstamp_precision()) and call them only if we find them.
    
    On other UN*Xes, we still assume that we'll be running only on the
    release against which we were built and newer releases.

    Follow a suggestion from libtoolize:
    
    libtoolize: Consider adding 'AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS([./aclocal-fallback])' to
    configure.ac
    
    This is explained in the libtool manual:
    
    "In the future other Autotools will automatically check the contents of
    AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS, but at the moment it is more portable to add the macro
    directory to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS in Makefile.am, which is where the tools currently
    look. If libtoolize doesn't see AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS, it too will
    honour the first -I argument in ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS when
    choosing a directory to store libtool configuration macros in. It is perfectly
    sensible to use both AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS and ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS, as long as they
    are kept in synchronisation."

    Handle PackageMaker a bit better.
    
    Look for the binary in various places, rather than looking for
    particular directories and adding them to the path.  That lets us use
    the PackageMaker binary from the PackageMaker.app bundle (it can either
    be run as a GUI app or from the command line), so you don't have to have
    a symlink to it from one of the directories in question.

commit 74e8613
Author: Jeff Morriss <jeff.morriss.ws@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 31 14:16:11 2014 -0400

    Don't check the checksum if we're encapsulated in an (ICMP) error packet.
    
    This is the case when an ICMP echo is returned (e.g., because it's too big).
    
    This effectively applies SVN rev 36193 to ICMPv6.

Date:   Fri Oct 31 12:27:30 2014 -0700

    Undo my personal disabling of the Qt download/build/install.
    
    I did that because I didn't want to wait a day for Qt to build, but
    didn't intend to make that change in the official source.
    
    In the longer term, we should perhaps change the script to download and
    install a binary package; sadly, their installers can't be made 100%
    command-line and automated, but, well, the CMake installer pops up a
    dialog, too, and if you don't have Java installed, some of the configure
    scripts that check for Java pop up non-blocking "do you want to install
    Java?" dialogs from OS X.

commit 3426ffa
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Fri Oct 31 12:11:22 2014 -0700

    For OS X, don't rigidly tie the SDK version to the minimum target version.
    
    According to
    
    	https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/cross_development/Configuring/configuring.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000163i-CH1-SW1
    
    the deployment target (minimum target OS version) and SDK version aren't
    necessarily the same and, in fact, Apple typically only ship two SDKs
    with each Xcode release, so if you want to build for 10.6 with the 10.6
    SDK, you have to use a version of Xcode sufficiently old to have the
    10.6 SDK.
    
    Here, we instead search for the oldest SDK for an OS whose version is
    greater than or equal to the deployment target.  Note that this may not
    work for X11-based Wireshark, as the X11 libraries can change
    incompatibly between releases.  (Fortunately, our plan is to kick
    X11-based Wireshark to the curb for OS X, removing a large pile of
    aggravation for users.)
    
    This also requires some fixes when building Qt and gdk-pixbuf, as some
    cases where we were using the minimum OS target version we needed to be
    using the SDK version.
    
    For CMake, we're using its native "deployment target" support for OS X,
    and hope that it will somehow do the right thing.

    Add logic to determine if a "tvb get" call is used as a parameter to a proto_tree_add_text call. convert_proto_tree_add_text.pl has an easier time determining hf_ field values with a "tvb get" call present, so it's more likely those dissectors will be picked first in eliminating their proto_tree_add_text calls.

    DNS NXT RR is parsed incorrectly
    
    The queries RRs and answers RRs are parsed fine.
    However, only the first 2 authoritative RRs are parsed and none of the 3 additional RRs are parsed.
    The second authoritative RR is of type NXT, and even though it has data length of 9, Wireshark reads all the bytes until the end of the packet as if they are part of bitmap in this RR (it reads 317 bytes too many).
    This causes it to not parse the rest of the RRs correctly.

    Bug 9586 says bit 0x00000100 in the "802.11n flags" means "802.11ac".
    
    Also, the 0x00000100 flag is "MCS index used", if a dissection of an
    802.11n frame by OmniPeek is to be believed and if the "802.11n flags"
    have the same meaning in Peek tagged files and in the Peek remote
    protocol.
    
    Rename that field to "extended flags", as it's not just for 802.11n, add

    1. Option-Code and Reserved fields should be 1 byte, not 2 in Local Mobility Anchor Address mobility option
    2. IPv6 AUTH mobility option parses Mobility SPI
    3. IPv6 MESG-ID (should just be a timestamp field)
    4. IPv6 Redirect Mobility Option K and N bits are parsed incorrectly
    
    5. The following options had a field that read until the end of the packet instead of the end of the option:
    DNS-UPDATE-TYPE
    AUTH Authentication Data
    Care Of Test
    Permanent Home Keygen Token
    CGA Parameters

    well under Ubuntu.
    
    Use QFontMetricsF::lineSpacing for our line height.
    
    Note that we don't support the BOLD gui.hex_dump_highlight_style
    preference. Leave a hint for anyone wishing to do so. Comment out
    related code for now.

    ncp2222: initialize buffer in build_expert_data
    
    We do a bunch of conditional logic to fill in the buffer, and then were checking
    strlen(buffer) to see if we'd actually filled it in or not, but if we hadn't
    then the buffer was garbage and strlen(buffer) was throwing valgrind warnings.
    Ensure this works as intended by setting the first byte of the buffer
    unconditionally at the beginning, so strlen(buffer) returns 0 as expected in
    that case.

    Leave it around in case InterfaceTree::display() gets invoked without an

    (as it frees global_capture_opts.ifaces_err_info before setting it

    Android: Add ADB dissector
    
    Previoulsy added "adb_cs" is only for adb client <-> adb daemon communication
    by loopback interface (by TCP). But there is also communication between
    adb daemon and device (by TCP or USB). This transport protocol is different, but
    now support is done.
    
    ADB services are shared between ADB and ADB_CS so put them into "adb_service"
    dissector. There is still some services to be added.

    Handle an hfindex of -1.
    
    Code generated by the current version of Pidl dissects bitset fields
    twice - once with proto_tree_add_item(), which puts the actual item into
    the tree, so that we can create a subtree under it, and once with a
    dissect_dcerpc_{type}() routine, to fetch the value and step past the
    field.  The second call passes an hf_ index value of -1; interpret that
    as meaning "don't put this into the protocol tree", rather than just
    blindly calling proto_tree_add_XXX with -1 and getting a dissector
    assertion.

    Eliminate use of ctype.h routines.
    
    That way, we don't do locale-sensitive case-insensitivity (yes, the
    locale can affect case-mapping - in a Turkish locale, "I" isn't the
    upper-case version of "i", for example).

Date:   Sun Oct 19 00:29:35 2014 -0400

    Remove unnecessary tvb_ensure_bytes_exist calls.
    
    All of the calls removed are followed by proto_tree_add_xxx calls of the same offset/length of the tvb_ensure_bytes_exist call.  The proto_tree_add_xxx calls should throw the exception, so we don't need the "double check".
    There are probably more calls that can be removed, these were just obvious as first glance, spurred mostly by noticing the (ab)use in packet-wsp.c

    IPv6: QuickStart option Nonce is read incorrectly
    
    In Wireshark, the option's TTL field looks ok, but the [TTL diff] field points to the byte after the TTL field, which is part of the nonce field.
    The nonce field is being read one byte after where it should be read and so the value being read is incorrect.
    Moreover, the option data length says 6 but because of the extra byte being read 7 bytes are being read for this option data and the next option is read one byte later incorrectly so the options after the QuickStart option are being read incorrectly.

    MIPv6: Mobility Option IPv6 Address/Prefix marks too many bytes for the address/prefix field
    
    One of the mobility options is the IPv6 Address/Prefix.
    The prefix length of this option is 52.
    Note that according to RFC 5568, the prefix length is in bits and not in bytes.
    The IPv6 Address/Prefix field of this option marks 52 bytes.
    
    In addition, I'm not sure that the IPv6 Address/Prefix field is a variable size field.
    RFC 5568 section 6.4.2 has a diagram of this options that shows this field as if it always takes 128 bits, and the prefix length field just says the length of the prefix (not the length of the field).

    Just have get_mac_lte_rapid_description() return the description string.

    (If the code ever needs to determine in other places whether rapid ranges

    get_mac_lte_rapid_description() could return NULL in that case and the
    code using the string can check for a null value.)

Date:   Wed Oct 15 16:55:54 2014 -0700

    Don't allocate the interfaces array until we've read the SHB.
    
    Nothing from the SHB gets stored in the interfaces array - it's filled
    in from IDBs - so it doesn't need to exist when we read the first SHB,
    and thus doesn't need to be freed if the attempt to read the SHB gets an
    error or a "this isn't a pcap-ng file" indication.
    
    Update a comment while we're at it.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Wed Oct 15 16:45:51 2014 -0700

    Clean up the read routines.
    
    The block read routines don't need to return a "bytes read" amount any
    more.
    
    Have pcapng_read_block() just return an indication:
    
    	PCAPNG_BLOCK_OK - the read succeeded;
    
    	PCAPNG_BLOCK_NOT_SHB - the read failed in a fashion that
    	    indicates that we might just not be reading a pcap-ng file;
    
    	PCAPNG_BLOCK_ERROR - the read failed in some other fashion
    	    (i.e., we already have concluded that the file is a pcap-ng
    	    file, or we got an I/O error).
    
    In the cases where it needs to know whether it's reading the first block
    for an open, have it check the shb_read flag, rather than being passed a
    separate Boolean argument.
    
    This means that pcapng_read_section_header_block() should return such an
    indication as well.
    
    Make the other block-reading routines return a Boolean success/failure
    indication.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Oct 14 16:53:03 2014 -0700

    We can't check the length of an SHB until we determine the byte order.
    
    Don't check a possibly-byte-swapped length against the minimum SHB size;
    it'll probably look huge if it's byte-swapped, so the test won't fail
    even if it is too small, and a really huge SHB's length could look too
    small if it's byte-swapped.
    
    Do the check *after* we've read the fixed-length portion of the block;
    yes, that means we've read past the purported size of the block at that
    point, but if that read succeeds, that doesn't matter, and if that read
    fails, it just means we'll report "file cut short" rather than "bad SHB
    length", *both* of which are problems with the file.

    Don't assume pcap_read_block() returns the number of bytes read.
    
    Recent changes must have made it not do so in some cases, and
    our current version of file_tell(), unlike ftell() around which the
    older file_tell() was a wrapper, is known to be cheap (ftell() would
    make a system call to get the position).  Just use file_tell() before
    each read.
    
    (Further cleanup is called for.)

    extcap: Remove single-space argument for boolflags
    
     Boolflags will be added with a NULL argument to the
     list and therefore the original fix will work.
    
     Note: extcap_get_complex_as_string will convert any NULL
     value into a single character argument (' '). Therefore
     any argument type, where NULL is a special value should
     be handled seperately here. For now, the only datatype
     will be BOOLFLAG

    extcap: Catch unknown arguments to fix spaces
    
     - If boolflags are being used, an extra space is added
       to the call of the extcap filter. This leads to the
       argumentparser of python to exit with an error-code,
       and the extcap filter will not start. This patch instead
       catches the unknown arguments and prints them on stdout,
       as well as running the dissection with the rest of the
       arguments list.
    
       Basically this is a work-around, for a behaviour not
       yet fixed in extcap, but it stabilizes the usage of the demo

    Fixed missing padding. Fixed ENC_NA/ENC_BIG_ENDIAN errors.
    
    There was no tree items for padding in the many instances where there were
    bytes added to make certain data types align on even boundaries of 2, 4, or
    8 bytes. These instances now show up as "Padding" in the display.
    
    There were many instances where ENC_NA was used for fields of more than one
    byte. This wasn't noticed before because ENC_NA was ENC_BIG_ENDIAN for
    historical reasons and all these fields are big endian fields.

    Make boolean bitmask type 64-bit wide
    
    There are protocols out there that have 64-bit wide bit mask fields, so

    For this, the ws_ctz() fallback and bits_count_ones() have to be tweaked
    slightly.

    location where it appears to be; if they ever differ, we'll need the
    file in order to reverse-engineer some more.

    	1) not writing the full file size;
    
    	2) not writing the packet count in the right location.
    
    Detect files written by the old code, and get the packet count from the
    right location for those files.

    wtap_file_read_till_separator() can return values other than 1 on success.
    
    It returns the length of the string it read, so only treat 0 and -1 as
    errors.  (0 either means "EOF" or "string is zero length", but this is
    only in the code that reads numbers, and a number needs at least 1
    digit, so both EOF and "zero-length string" mean "this isn't a valid
    Peek tagged file".)

    Don't treat int return values as valid wtap_open_return_val values.
    
    They happen to be, at least now, but that's not valid in C++, and it's
    probably unwise in any case.

    Cast size_t to to gulong as the length argument to g_snprintf().
    
    Sadly, the GTK+ folks decided not to use size_t for the size argument,
    so it doesn't do the right thing on LLP64 platforms such as Windows.

Date:   Thu Oct 9 11:37:27 2014 -0700

    CMake: Build an application bundle (Wireshark.app) on OS X.
    
    Add an ENABLE_APPLICATION_BUNDLE option which is enabled by default on
    OS X and disabled elsewhere. The bundle is currently bare-bones and only
    contains the main executables, Info.plist, and application icon.
    
    Capitalize the main application name when ENABLE_APPLICATION_BUNDLE is
    set and on Windows.
    
    Start updating CPackConfig.txt for OS X packaging.
    
    To do:
    
      - Add supporting libraries and frameworks.
    
      - Make the bundle standalone. I.e. call FIXUP_BUNDLE or
        replicate the relevant parts of osx-app.sh

commit a566f61
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Oct 7 16:18:47 2014 -0700

    No need for WTAP_ERR_CANT_READ.
    
    Unlike the standard I/O routines, the code we introduced that supports
    fast random seeking on gzipped files will always supply some specific
    error code for read errors, so we don't need WTAP_ERR_CANT_READ.
    
    Add WTAP_ERR_CANT_WRITE for writing, as we're still using the standard
    I/O routines for that.  Set errno to WTAP_ERR_CANT_WRITE before calling
    fwrite() in wtap_dump_file_write(), so that it's used if fwrite() fails
    without setting errno.

Date:   Tue Oct 7 07:51:52 2014 -0400

    Overhaul the filterability of packet-ansi_683.c
    
    It's (ab)use of proto_tree_add_text was "hidden" behind a single FT_NONE hf item, that effectively had the same behavior of proto_tree_add_text, but wouldn't show up in checkAPIs.pl.  Replaced the (over 200+) proto_tree_add_none_format calls with proto_tree_add_text and then ran convert_proto_tree_add_text.pl on the dissector.  That started the cleanup, and I did more while in the neighborhood.
