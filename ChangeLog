    sigcomp-udvm: fix invalid access
    
    Way back in 2006, svn r20041 (now gd408f2f6fc) worked around a problem by
    limiting the amount of buffer dealt with in the udvm_state_access call (changing
    it from state_minimum_access_length_buff[n] to STATE_MIN_ACCESS_LEN).
    
    The very next line however, tries to read the same amount of buffer to display
    to the user - since it seems nobody ever applied a proper fix for the original
    case, just apply the same workaround to the second call.

    Use g_ascii_isalnum() rather than isalnum().
    
    Only *ASCII* alphanumerics are allowed in filterable field names, so use
    g_ascii_isalnum() to check for them.  That avoids issues with characters
    with the 8th bit set and avoids locale-dependent behavior.

    1. Option-Code and Reserved fields should be 1 byte, not 2 in Local Mobility Anchor Address mobility option
    2. IPv6 AUTH mobility option parses Mobility SPI
    3. IPv6 MESG-ID (should just be a timestamp field)
    4. IPv6 Redirect Mobility Option K and N bits are parsed incorrectly
    
    5. The following options had a field that read until the end of the packet instead of the end of the option:
    DNS-UPDATE-TYPE
    AUTH Authentication Data
    Care Of Test
    Permanent Home Keygen Token
    CGA Parameters

    ncp2222: initialize buffer in build_expert_data
    
    We do a bunch of conditional logic to fill in the buffer, and then were checking
    strlen(buffer) to see if we'd actually filled it in or not, but if we hadn't
    then the buffer was garbage and strlen(buffer) was throwing valgrind warnings.
    Ensure this works as intended by setting the first byte of the buffer
    unconditionally at the beginning, so strlen(buffer) returns 0 as expected in
    that case.

    ASCII, i.e. printable ASCII except for a space, use g_ascii_isgraph().

    This is a temporary/preliminary fix to prevent the buildbot fuzz-test
     failures seen when testing the capture file attached to Bug #10582.
    
    As noted in the bug, a complete fix will require some reworking of

    MIPv6: Mobility Option Binding Authorization Data for FMIPv6 Authenticator field is read beyond the option data
    
    There's a single IPv6 packet with Binding Authorization Data for FMIPv6 mobility option.
    The option's data length is 14 but and since the SPI takes 4 bytes, the Authenticator field should take 10 bytes.
    However, the Authenticator field is read until the end of the packet, which is 178 bytes.

    MIPv6: Mobility Option IPv6 Address/Prefix marks too many bytes for the address/prefix field
    
    One of the mobility options is the IPv6 Address/Prefix.
    The prefix length of this option is 52.
    Note that according to RFC 5568, the prefix length is in bits and not in bytes.
    The IPv6 Address/Prefix field of this option marks 52 bytes.
    
    In addition, I'm not sure that the IPv6 Address/Prefix field is a variable size field.
    RFC 5568 section 6.4.2 has a diagram of this options that shows this field as if it always takes 128 bits, and the prefix length field just says the length of the prefix (not the length of the field).

    mrcpv2: don't use an uninitialized buffer as a string
    
    I have no idea what the original intent was with this magical
    otherwise-totally-unused buffer, but it clearly serves no purpose now. Stop
    reading garbage from it, and just read the data in the packet which is what the
    field name suggests.

    Define DO_MV as "mv" or "sudo mv", depending on whether the user has

    glibtool* and vice versa.

    Add file_error() calls after file_read().
    
    If file_read() doesn't return the exact number of bytes you asked for,
    and you really need all those bytes to be there, you have to call
    file_error() to find out what the problem is.

    Set err_info if the attempts to read record headers fail.
    
    If it fails due to, for example, the file being gzipped and having a bad
    gzip CRC, the error returned is WTAP_ERR_DECOMPRESS and, for that error,
    err_info is expected to be set to a string giving details of the
    problem, so we need to pass back to our caller the string in question.
