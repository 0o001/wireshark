    kafka: Don't try to decompress if the length is zero.

    There's no point in trying to decompress a message with
    length zero, and some of the third party decompression
    libraries (e.g. zstd) can give unexpected results that
    lead to infinite loops if we do so. A message length zero
    is almost surely a file with errors.

    Qt: ElidedLabel escapes HTML

    ElidedLabel escapes HTML after !9261, so use its own methods to make text
    small and italicized instead of passing in rich text.

    IOGraphDialog used to make an error message, if it existed, bold.
    Perhaps ElidedLabel should have a way to have prepended bold
    text for such usage.

    lwm2mtlv: Fix resource id lookup

    The LwM2M object instance and resource id may be given in both the
    CoAP Uri-Path and the LwM2M TLV header, and in this case the created
    uri_path is wrong and resource id lookup will fail.

    Change the logic to get object id from CoAP Uri-Path and resource id
    from either Uri-Path or LwM2M TLV header.

    Qt: Accept ColoringRulesDialog after writing colors

    Instead of connecting ColoringRulesDialog's buttonBox accepted()
    signal to two different slots (once in the .ui file, and one
    automatically from a name), accept the dialog only after writing
    the colors.

    This prevents starting to recolor the PacketList before the new color
    list has been been written.

    Fix #12475. Fix #15471.

    tcp: Throw exception instead of ASSERT for unknown PDU length

    If a subdissector requests one more segment for a PDU of unknown length,
    but we can't do reassembly for whatever reason, that's not necesarily a
    dissector bug (while it could be the result of a bad heuristic, it can
    happen from a checksum failing validation or reassembly preferences
    disabled.)

    The correct error is a FragmentBoundsError (dissector requested bytes
    that it couldn't get due to not being reassembled), which is what
    we would also throw if the returned PDU length were greater than the
    tvb length instead of unknown. Fix #16689.

    NFS: Fix string decoding to use UTF-8

    Use tvb_get_string_enc() to read a string.

    I think NFSv3 doesn't specify an encoding so interoperabilty
    is dicey. I believe NFSv4 specifies UTF-8.

    Fixes #18628.

    plugin directories. Fixes #15592.

    Fix display of help file path name in error dialog.

    Display it as a pathname in the native format (e.g., C:\this\is\wrong),
    not as the path component of the URL supplied (e.g., /C/this/is/wrong).

    Fixes some confusion that appeared in a comment in #15592 (but not the
    underlying bug - fixing that bug should prevent that dialog from popping
    up in the first place).

    UMTS RLC: AMD and UMD PDUs can be larger than 255 bytes

    AMD and UMD PDUs can be larger than 255 bytes, so the
    offset should not be stored in a guint8. Otherwise,
    the offset overflows and the last 256 bytes of the PDU
    are added as an extra "fragment."

    bpv6: Fix possible infinite loop

    display_extension_block is supposed to return the current offset,
    not the number of bytes remaining. The number of bytes remaining
    can be less than the current offset and cause an infinite loop.

    In the case of an error, set lastheader and return the current
    offset in order to break out of the main processing loop.

    Fix #18711.
