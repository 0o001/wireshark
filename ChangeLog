    Don't write out statistics if we don't have any.
    
    We don't know when the capture started or ended (the time stamps of the
    first and last packets aren't necessarily the time when the capture
    started or ended), we don't know how many packets were dropped in the
    capture process, and we don't know how many packets were seen in various
    stages before they were received by whatever software dumped them out as
    text, so we have no statistics to report.

    WPA/WPA2 decoding fixes and improvements
    
    - start decoding when we have eapol1+2 packets
      Do not insist on a complete captured handshake, decode what we can.
    
    - more robust way to detect eapol #2 packets
      At least Win 10 is violating the spec on rekey by setting the secure
      bit in #2. Unpatched version shows and handles #2 as #4, breaking
      decoding after rekey.
    
    - fixed eapol rekey key handling
      Inital patch (see https://code.wireshark.org/review/8268)
      is adding redundant keys, since it scans all the time
      and not only once.
    
    - ignore tailing garbage after eapol sections in frame
      See https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9065#c8
    
    Included testcase to test decode for incomplete handshakes and eapol2
    packets with secure bit set on rekey.

    Pick array sizes based on what they're supposed to hold.
    
    In AirPDcapRsnaPwd2PskStep(), digest[] holds an SSID plus 4 bytes of

    SHA-1 digest, so the size is SHA1_DIGEST_LEN.
    
    That makes it a bit clearer why those are the sizes.

    IEEE 802.11: 802.1X (WPA-EAP) rekeying support
    
    This patch extends the existing decryption support for WPA to also
    handle rekeys by checking each decrypted packet for a 4-way-handshake.
    
    Rekeys can be used for WPA-PSK, but are more common with WPA-Enterprise
    (WPA-EAP).
    
    For decrypting WPA-EAP secured packets the user must provide all used PMK's
    of the connection (aka PSK's) as WPA-PSK 32 byte hex values to wireshark
    via the existing interface.
    (The capture must have all 4-way-handshakes included also, starting with
    the first unencrypted one.)
    
    Every decrypted unicast packet will habe the used PMK and TK shown in the
    CCMP/TKIP section below the key index in the GUI. Group packets will display the
    GTK instead.
    
    Additionally this fixes a small issue with group rekey handling, so every packet
    can be selected in the GUI in random order, removing the need to manually find
    the correct group keying packets prior to that.
    
    It was tested primary with WPA-CCMP, but TKIP is also working.
    
    One section in the code touch bluetooth 802.1X support. It should do
    exactly the same, but will now also examine all decypted packets for rekeys.

    Add missing ERF types, mention another missing type, mention reserved space.
    
    Add the TYPE_COLOR_HASH_POS and TYPE_COLOR_HASH_ETH types, note that
    type 26 has no #define, mention that types 28 through 31 are reserved
    for future record types.

Date:   Tue Dec 15 16:39:27 2015 -0800

    Don't report an error for a non-multiple-of-4 chunk length.
    
    To quote RFC 4960:
    
    Chunk Length: 16 bits (unsigned integer)
    
          This value represents the size of the chunk in bytes, including
          the Chunk Type, Chunk Flags, Chunk Length, and Chunk Value fields.
          Therefore, if the Chunk Value field is zero-length, the Length
          field will be set to 4.  *The Chunk Length field does not count any
          chunk padding.*
    
          Chunks (including Type, Length, and Value fields) are padded out
          by the sender with all zero bytes to be a multiple of 4 bytes
          long.  This padding MUST NOT be more than 3 bytes in total.  The
          Chunk Length value does not include terminating padding of the
          chunk.  However, it does include padding of any variable-length
          parameter except the last parameter in the chunk.  The receiver
          MUST ignore the padding.
    
          Note: A robust implementation should accept the chunk whether or
          not the final padding has been included in the Chunk Length.
    
    so the the chunk is *not* required to include the length of the final
    padding in the chunk, although any padding *between* variable-length
    parameters in the chunk must be included in the length (obviously, as
    it's part of the chunk data).

    Undo my personal disabling of the Qt download/build/install.
    
    I did that because I didn't want to wait a day for Qt to build, but
    didn't intend to make that change in the official source.
    
    In the longer term, we should perhaps change the script to download and
    install a binary package; sadly, their installers can't be made 100%
    command-line and automated, but, well, the CMake installer pops up a
    dialog, too, and if you don't have Java installed, some of the configure
    scripts that check for Java pop up non-blocking "do you want to install
    Java?" dialogs from OS X.

commit 1caf362
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Fri Oct 31 12:11:22 2014 -0700

    For OS X, don't rigidly tie the SDK version to the minimum target version.
    
    According to
    
    	https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/cross_development/Configuring/configuring.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000163i-CH1-SW1
    
    the deployment target (minimum target OS version) and SDK version aren't
    necessarily the same and, in fact, Apple typically only ship two SDKs
    with each Xcode release, so if you want to build for 10.6 with the 10.6
    SDK, you have to use a version of Xcode sufficiently old to have the
    10.6 SDK.
    
    Here, we instead search for the oldest SDK for an OS whose version is
    greater than or equal to the deployment target.  Note that this may not
    work for X11-based Wireshark, as the X11 libraries can change
    incompatibly between releases.  (Fortunately, our plan is to kick
    X11-based Wireshark to the curb for OS X, removing a large pile of
    aggravation for users.)
    
    This also requires some fixes when building Qt and gdk-pixbuf, as some
    cases where we were using the minimum OS target version we needed to be
    using the SDK version.
    
    For CMake, we're using its native "deployment target" support for OS X,
    and hope that it will somehow do the right thing.

    Clamp zooming so that we don't get zero or negative font sizes.
    
    Those are obviously wrong.
    
    Also, clean up some stuff left over from the GTK+ 1.x days; GTK+ 2.x
    doesn't expose raw XLFD font names, it lets you specify a font by name
    and size, and font_zoom() doesn't determine whether the font is
    resizeable - it just constructs a new font name/size pair and leaves it
    up to its callers to try to load the font, so "there's no such font as
    Wingdings Gothic" and "you can't blow up Fraktur to 10 million points"
    both show up as errors loading the font by name.

    Fix buffer overrun in zlib decompression
    
    After updating next_in (to remove the gzip header), avail_in must also
    be updated. Failing to do makes zlib read past the input buffer. In
    theory this would resukt in a buffer overrun of at most double the input
    length, in practice zlib returns as soon as the compression fails (after
    reading a few bytes).

    spdy: do not overwrite HTTPS registration
    
    Setting a zero port still allows it for selection in the UAT dialog
    while not breaking HTTPS dissection.
    
    (In theory the UAT setting would work. In practice it would still call
    ssl_dissector_add and take over the SSL registration for all tcp/443
    traffic. On removal with ssl_dissector_remove, the HTTPS port is not
    added back again until a restart (or until the HTTPS ports list is
    changed from the default) because the spdy registration overwrites the
    HTTP one...)
    
    Also note that NPN detection for SPDY is not implemented, only ALPN
    detection is supported.

    EtherCAT: wrong display name
    
    Wireshark is showing 2 consecutive bytes named "SubIdx" in a SDO info request (OpCode = 0x5) and response (OpCode = 0x6). But the second byte should be the "ValueInfo" instead in both request and response.
