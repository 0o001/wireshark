    debian: remove imagemagick and demote xdg-utils deps
    
    imagemagick was needed since v1.11.1-rc1-140-g02a8e72b43, but
    unnecessary since v2.1.0rc0-491-g18a54fcaa4, remove it.
    xdg-utils is needed for xdg-open (opening websites) at runtime in GTK+,
    but not for Qt nor during the build, remove it or mark it as optional.

    dns: improve loop detection in label decompression
    
    Previously the number of allowed pointers within a message is equal to
    the data in a tvb (16575 in one example). This is still expensive, so
    implement an alternative detection mechanism that looks for a direct
    self-loop and limits the total pointers to about 256.

    Qt: Inhibit Disable Protocol when applicable
    
    The packet details context menu allows you, through the Protocol
    Preferences sub menu to manipulate (disable) the protocol dissection
    through the Disable <protocol>... option. This opens up the appropriate
    dialog and select the applicable protocol.
    This fails for protocols which have their can_toggle flag reset (e.g.
    the frame protocol). The dialog opens, but the protocol can't be found,
    hence the top item is selected.
    
    Instead disable the menu option for protocols which can't have their
    enabled state toggled.

    Get rid of a message that should no longer apply.
    
    The version of pkg-config downloaded and built by macosx-setup.sh
    defaults to looking in, among other places, /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig, so
    you don't need to add that to PKG_CONFIG_PATH on macOS; Wireshark for
    macOS no longer uses X11, so you don't need to add
    /usr/X11/lib/pkgconfig to PKG_CONFIG_PATH on macOS.

    slsk: fix infinite loop
    
    If check_slsk_format reports that the buffer does not contain the
    expected data, do not try to find more items (break out of the loop).
    
    In one case, an infinite loop would occur because the index variable was
    not incremented when the check fails. In all other cases, it would
    perform up to 2^32 calls to check_slsk_format per loop (with the same
    offset parameter, so no exception is triggered).

    RTCP: Handle large TMMBR value presentation
    
    TMMBR can be _very_ large (131072*2^63, larger than 64 bit entities can
    hold). Therefore don't try to calculate and present the bitrate as an
    integer value, but as an expression.

    netflow: fix undefined shift
    
    Treat any prefix length larger than 32 as 32 (effectively not masking
    anything) and treat a zero-length prefix as the empty mask (matching
    anything).

    Squelch some compiler warnings.
    
    Cast an ssize_t value to unsigned int before subtracting it from an
    unsigned int.  The value is already known to be >= 0 and <= the value
    from which we're subtracting it, and that latter value is an unsigned
    int, so it's guaranteed to fit into an unsigned int.  (ssize_t can be
    bigger than unsigned int.)
