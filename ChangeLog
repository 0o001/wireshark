    dmp: Allow multiple SecurityCategories again
    
    A Security Classification in DMP may have multiple Security Categories
    so don't restrict this to only one.  Add a arbitrary limit of 255 to
    avoid a long dissector loop in malformed packets.
    
    This fixes a bug introduced in g85bbda51.

    Fix stripping of binaries.
    
    Instead of using the never-defined $binpath (undefined going back to at
    least Wireshark 1.0.0 - is it a leftover from the Inkscape version?),
    use $bundle_binary_list, to strip all the executables with strip -ur.
    
    (Not that we want to strip anything - we don't even want the debugging
    symbols stripped! - but for cleanliness.)

    cs_binary_list to bundle_binary_list, and use it when checking for

    Check for dependencies in all subdirectories of $pkglib and $pkgexec.
    
    Just use "find" to find plain files under $pkglib and $pkgexec; this
    avoids trying to run otool on directories, which can cause it to stop
    looking in $pkgexec/* past the extcap directory, and does try to run it
    on the Qt frameworks in subdirectories under $pkglib.
    
    Add a comment giving more details about the big command to find
    dependencies.

    %PATH%. Strawberry Perl doesn't include DocBook, which makes it useless
    as far as we're concerned.
    
    Another approach would be to look in various locations for an XML catalog
    files and set %XML_CATALOG_FILES%. However, Cygwin's /etc/xml/catalog
    contains Cygwin-specific URLs, e.g. file:///etc/xml/docbook and can't
    be used with a non-Cygwin xsltproc.

    Take a hint from the QToolButton sources and update the filter
    expression toolbar using updateGeometry instead of adjustSize. This
    appears to do the layout updates and other changes required to draw the
    dropdown in the correct place.

    Do the maximum block size check in pcap_read_block().
    
    Do it before we even *try* to read the block, so that it's done in one
    place rather than having to be done in every routine to handle
    particular block types.
    
    The check was missing in the routine to read sysdig event blocks, so if
    we got a huge sysdig even block we'd try to allocate a huge amount of
    memory.
