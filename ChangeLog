    CMake: fix some warnings reported by CMake 3.17
    
    Newer version of CMake complains with warnings like the one below:
    
    The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (MINIZIP)
    does not match the name of the calling package (Minizip).  This can lead to
    problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
    (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
    
    Change the capitalization of the variables to match the filename.

Date:   Wed Oct 28 12:02:29 2020 +0100

    Create protocols to the end of the TVB if length unknown upfront
    
    Creating protocols with unknown length must be created to the end of the TVB
    first and reined back using proto_set_len() once the length becomes known.
    Not doing so can make indentification of problems harder and prevents analysis
    engines like MATE from properly processing the generated protocol trees.
    With this change the remaining offending dissectors are corrected for this.
    
    Closes #16961

    Apparently, WS_WIKI_URL() is unworkable not only in C++ but in C.
    
    If you use it, GCC 9.3.0 seems to think there's a missing parenthesis
    somewhere, just as the version of clang++ in my version of Xcode does,
    even though other versions of GCC don't.  I'm clearly missing something
    obscure about C here; I give up.

    Include <stdint.h> in YACC/Bison parsers if necessary.
    
    MSVC doesn't, by default, define __STDC_VERSION__, which means that the
    code generated by newer versions of winflexbison3's Bison end up
    defining YYPTRDIFF_T as long, which is wrong on 64-bit Windows, as
    that's an LLP64 platform, not an LP64 platform, and causes warnings to
    be generated.  Those warnings turn into errors.
    
    With MSVC, if __STDC_VERSION__ isn't defined, Forcibly include
    <stdint.h> here to work around that.
    
    Fixes #16924.

    CMake: Configure our .y files for different Bison/YACC flavors.
    
    Bison 3.4 and later generate deprecation warnings for the "%pure-parser"
    directive. As https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bison.git/tree/NEWS says,
    
    ----
    ** Deprecated features
    
      The %pure-parser directive is deprecated in favor of '%define api.pure'
      since Bison 2.3b (2008-05-27), but no warning was issued; there is one
      now.  Note that since Bison 2.7 you are strongly encouraged to use
      '%define api.pure full' instead of '%define api.pure'.
    ----
    
    Rename our .y files to .y.in, and modify FindYACC.cmake to detect newer
    versions of Bison and configure our .y files with "%pure-parser" or
    "%define api.pure" as needed. Squelches warnings from Bison in #16924.

    Fix message printed for --skip-radiotap-header for non-radiotap packets.
    
    If the encapsulation is WTAP_ENCAP_PER_PACKET, all we know about the
    file is that it might not include radiotap packets and, if it does, it
    also includes non-radiotap packets.
    
    If it's *not* WTAP_ENCAP_PER_PACKET, properly report it
    (wtap_file_type_subtype() returns the *file type* of the file, not the
    *link-layer header type* - yes, that *happens* to work for a pcap file
    with Ethernet packets, because the values of WTAP_ENCAP_ETHERNET and
    WTAP_FILE_TYPE_SUBTYPE_PCAP both *happen* to be 1, but that's pure
    luck).
    
    While we're at it, test only once for --skip-radiotap-header and put
    both tests inside that if.
