Date:   Tue Nov 28 15:06:13 2017 -0800

    Report the actual *error* for CANT_GET_INTERFACE_LIST.
    
    CANT_GET_INTERFACE_LIST does *NOT* mean "No remote interfaces found.",
    as in "there are no remote interfaces"; a NULL return from
    get_remote_interface_list() and an err value of 0 means that.
    CANT_GET_INTERFACE_LIST means "something bad happened and the error
    string says what it is".  Display that error string, so when people
    report problems:
    
            https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/issues/666
    
    they'll give the actual error message, and I'll fix my breakage of the
    rpcap protocol negotiation:
    
            https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/commit/2972769d03dd60d4bce233a12d77a3464f0d9dc4
    
    rather than just wondering what the problem was and asking the reporter
    of the problem for more information.
    
    Report anything other than "there are no remote interfaces" as an error,
    not a warning.

    3GPP 24.008 is not very explicit regarding the encoding, but after
    rereading 3GPP 23.003 and 3GPP 29.272, it is most likely the E.164

    Link with ZLIB_LIBRARIES if you link with wiretap.
    
    Wiretap may use zlib; if it does, ZLIB_LIBRARIES is set to refer to
    zlib.  On UN*X, you may be able to get away with linking a
    dynamically-linked shared library with other dynamically-linked shared
    libraries and not linking programs linked *with* that shared library
    with those other shared libraries, but that may not work on Windows.
    
    We link most programs that use wiretap with ZLIB_LIBRARIES; do so with
    androiddump and randpktdump as well.

    Use a union for the IPv4/IPv6 address.
    
    That way, the compiler ensures proper alignment.  In practice, the
    alignment was probably proper anyway, but this makes sure.

    Qt: fix crash after loading SRT dialog
    
    TapParameterDialog::on_applyFilterButton_clicked first calls fillTree to
    populate the table and endRetapPackets to add the results to GUI. The
    table data must remain valid until closing the dialog since the user can
    still interact with the GUI.

    Do not add Npcap path if npf.sys service is found
    
    Otherwise you can end with 2 Packet.dll (the one from WinPcap and the one
    from Npcap) being loaded at the same time, which can create incompatibilities.

    Update comment.
    
    Red Hat, at one point, provided a /usr/include/pcap/pcap.h without
    bothering to also provide a /usr/include/pcap.h that linked to it or
    included it, breaking source compatibility.  That's what we're working
    around when we search in both the top-level include directories and, if
    they exist, pcap subdirectories of those directories.
    
    libpcap 1.0 and later also put pcap.h in a pcap subdirectory, but also
    provided a pcap.h in the top-level include directory that included
    pcap/pcap.h, preserving source compatibility, so that's not the reason
    we're searching in the top-level include directories and their pcap
    subdirectories.
