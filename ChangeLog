    According to RFC 6062, once the connection is established, data is sent as-is
    To stop the STUN dissector from interfering, add the ability to specify a starting
    frame for a conversation dissector and use it

    ssl-utils: allow gcrypt without GnuTLS, improve structure
    
    Fix distinction between HAVE_LIBGNUTLS and HAVE_LIBGCRYPT. If GnuTLS is
    unavailable, then the only missing feature is decryption using an RSA
    private key file. Regardless of GnuTLS, allow SSL decryption (e.g. using
    a SSL key log file or a PSK configured via preferences).
    
    This change has no functional effect when GnuTLS and gcrypt are both
    available (or not). Additionally, decryption is possible if only
    libgcrypt is available.
    
    Further changes to make ssl-utils more maintainable and documented:
     - Group related functions, add markers and documentation. The following
       functions are moved (with no further modifications):
       - ssl_data_realloc, ssl_data_copy: related to StringInfo.
       - ssl_change_cipher, ssl_create_flow: related to the decryption of a
         session.
       - ssl_decompress_record: related to Record Decompression.
       - ssl_lib_init: moved to an arbitrary place.
       - ssl_set_server: moved closer to ssl_packet_from_server.
       - ssl_is_valid_content_type, ssl_is_valid_handshake_type: move closer
         to dissection code.
       - ssl_dissect_hnd_hello_ext_status_request,
         ssl_dissect_hnd_hello_ext_status_request_v2,
         ssl_dissect_hnd_hello_ext_elliptic_curves,
         ssl_dissect_hnd_hello_ext_ec_point_formats: move to TLS extensions.
     - Remove unused forward declaration of _gcry_rsa_decrypt.
     - ssl-packet-utils.h:
       - Remove ssl_equal, ssl_hash. These are only used in
         packet-ssl-utils.c.
       - ssl_private_key_equal, ssl_private_key_hash,
         ssl_common_register_options: inline when decryption is not
         possible.
       - Remove ws_symbol_export.h, enable SSL debug log when libgcrypt is
         compiled in (instead of depending on GnuTLS).
     - Move/merge stub code when GnuTLS or libgcrypt are not available:
       - ssl_find_cipher: move.
       - ssl_cipher_setiv: move.
       - ssl_generate_pre_master_secret, ssl_generate_keyring_material: move.
    
    Compile-tested all combinations:
     - no GnuTLS, no libgcrypt: CentOS 6.
     - no GnuTLS, has libgcrypt: CentOS 6. Passes all decryption tests
       except for the ones that need a RSA private key file.
     - has GnuTLS, no libgcrypt: Arch Linux.
     - has GnuTLS, has libgcrypt: Arch Linux. The decryption tests pass.
    (GnuTLS support is useless without gcrypt, but included for completeness.)

    Move the definition of MAX_NUM_COLOR_CONVERSATION_COLORS.
    
    It's only used by the GTK+ main menubar code, so put it there.  I guess
    the Qt UI either doesn't have such a limit or defines it itself.

    Tweak some names to better reflect what the named items are.
    
    The old "dissector filter" code used "_filter_" in some names; the new
    code used "_conv_", but they're not checking whether a *conversation* is
    valid and building a *conversation* string, they're checking whether a
    *filter* can be generated and building that *filter* string.

    "Color dissector filters" are just filters.
    
    Rename the color_dissector_filters.[ch] files to just
    dissector_filters.[ch], and rename the routines not to include the
    string "color_", as those filters can be used as color filters *or*
    display filters.
    
    Remove "color_" from other places where we're not doing colorization.
    
    In the GTK+ code, combine the two loops that add menu items for filters
    in the dissector-provided filters list into one.

    Just use g_mkdir_with_parents() to make the .config directory on UN*X.
    
    It will create all the relevant directories (if it can), using
    g_mkdir(), which is a wrapper for mkdir() on UN*X - just as ws_mkdir()
    is, so we don't need to make our own copy that uses ws_mkdir.

    frame_data: Reset subnum if visited is resetted
    
     subnum get's resetted when the file is reloaded. But subnum
     does not get resetted, if for instance a preference has been
     set directly via (Protocol Name)->Protocol Preferences-> ...
     in the Protocol list. But flags.visited get's resetted.
    
     This leads to the scenario, where reloading a trace starts subnum
     with 0 and applying a preference starts subnum with the highest
     value it had before.
    
     This patch ensures, that all methods for reloading the frame
     lead to the same init value

    Add preferences for related packets and the scroll bar minimap.
    
    Add gui.packet_list_show_related and gui.packet_list_show_minimap.
    Show_related enables and disables the related packet delegate.
    Show_minimap enables and disables the minimap. Start calling it the
    "intelligent scroll bar" since that's the best suggestion for a name
    I've seen so far.
    
    Leave them out of the Appearance preference pane for now.

    Add an item to the display filter bookmark menu which opens the filter
    expression preferences. We also need an expression editor frame similar
    to the column editor frame, but hopefully this will suffice until that

    Replace all "dissector filter" registrations with "dissector color filter" registration.
    
    In the GTK, there was "colorize" (via context menu using color_dissector_filter.{c,h}) or "not colorize" (via main menu using dissector_filters.{c,h}).  In Qt, you have the option to colorize (via context menu using color_dissector_filter.{c,h}) or not colorize (via main menu using color_dissector_filter.{c,h}).
    
    Combine all into "colorize" and convert GTK to use color_dissector_filter.{c,h} in the "not colorize" main menu like Qt.

Author: Jeff Morriss <jeff.morriss.ws@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Oct 24 22:22:38 2015 -0400

    There's no need for all these variables to be volatile.
    
    I suppose there must have been TRYs and CATCHes in here years ago. And/or
    there was just too much cutting-and-pasting going on here.
    
    Also reindent some col_ calls: they weren't moved left when check_col() was
    taken out.

    Require GnuTLS 2.12.0, add cmake version detection
    
    Since v2.1.0rc0-17-g877fd03 and v2.0.0rc0-23-g263ff53 ("ssl-utils:
    load RSA keys based on their modulus+exponent"), GnuTLS 2.12.0 is
    needed.
    
    Add a version check to cmake as well, tested on CentOS6 (with
    pkg-config check disabled to verify the code path). Note that RHEL6
    has GnuTLS 2.8.5 and thus SSL decryption with a RSA private key is no
    longer supported on that version.

    osx-app.sh fixups.
    
    For libraries, instead of prefixing dependent library paths with
    @executable_path/../Framework, prefix them with @rpath. This should let
    us load them from different directory depths.
    
    Remove any LC_RPATH not in an allowed list of prefixes. This should keep
    us from leaking paths specific to the build environment and user, and
    should make any portability problems more obvious.
    
    Add either @executable_path/../Frameworks or
    @executable_path/../../Frameworks as an LC_RPATH depending on which
    actually exists. This lets us place androiddump in the extcap
    subdirectory.
    
    Add error checking in a few places and make sure we detect failures in
    subshells.
    
    Add a macdeployqt buglink.

Date:   Tue Oct 20 08:31:52 2015 -0700

    Split RTP player tapping, decoding, and plotting.
    
    In RtpAudioStream split tapping+decoding into separate member functions.
    Store RTP payloads in memory. In RtpPlayerDialog split tapping+plotting.
    This more closely resembles what we're doing in the GTK+ UI and paves
    the way for jitter support and other changes.

    Update TDS dissector to latest version of protocol.
    
    Dissector updated to recognise and dissect up to TDS 7.4. Most response tokens
    now fully parsed and registered, allowing for much more granular filtering and
    output. Virtually all TDS datatypes now parsed and presented in human readable
    format.
    
    Version dependent decisions now default to TDS 7.2 in the absence of
    version information in the data, making successful dissection more likely.

    The size calculation for the struct will be wrong (too small) which looks

    there is only one request affected by this, and correct size calculation

    Keep CMake from finding Cygwin's Python.
    
    Try to find Python and set PYTHON_EXECUTABLE on Windows via the registry
    prior to calling FindPythonInterp. This works around a bug in CMake that
    prefers Cygwin's Python, which is a symlink, which by default is a text
    file that contains a Cygwin-specific cookie, which is therefore useless
    outside of Cygwin.
    
    This is avoids the need to pass -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=... to CMake.

    Revert "Another message from Clang for unknown -f and -m flags."
    
    This reverts commit 5e5e2019ee09fb0901f35948f570baff8a884adb.
    
    This change was proposed in https://cmake.org/Bug/view.php?id=13194 to
    catch some Clang warnings concerning invalid -m flags, but it is causing
    legitimate breakage when setting CMAKE_C_FLAGS=-gsplit-dwarf.
    CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log shows:
    
        /usr/bin/clang  -gsplit-dwarf -DC__W_VALID    CMakeFiles/cmTC_04cc8.dir/src.c.o  -o cmTC_04cc8 -rdynamic
        clang-3.7: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-gsplit-dwarf'
    
    With the additional regex, basic checks (like -Wall but also -fPIE) are
    incorrectly reported as unsupported. Follow upstreams action here and
    remove it, it is still not present as of CMake 3.3.2.

    cmake: always enable -Qunused-arguments for clang
    
    "argument unused during compilation" warnings suggest that some options
    do not make sense (such as passing the -gsplit-dwarf option to the
    linking command while it is only valid during compilation).
    
    For now we do not care about these warnings, the option is accepted by
    clang and whether it used in a particular step or not is uninteresting.
