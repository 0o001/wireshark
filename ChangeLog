    Clean up the "non-constant initalizers" stuff.
    
    We aren't, in this branch, insisting on C99 on UN*X, so we still warn
    against initializing aggregates, even if they have automatic storage
    duration, with non-constant values.  Put that into its own section, with
    some details, and take that out of the section on initializing global
    and static variables with non-constant values.
    
    (In practice, it'll probably Just Work, but we haven't pulled any of the
    *other* C99isms into this branch, and this branch is soon going to be
    less active once 2.4 is out, so we'll just leave the restrictions in.)
    
    For the latter section, expand the example in the hopes of avoiding
    confusion between "static storage duration" (which something declared
    "static" has, but which anything declared with file scope, whether
    declared "static" or not, also has) and "static storage duration and
    internal linkage", which is what the "static" keyword specifies.

    On UN*X, make sure we can find inflate() in libz.
    
    For example, on at least some versions of Fedora, if you have a 64-bit
    machine, have both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the run-time zlib
    package installed, and have only the *32-bit* version of the zlib
    development package installed, it'll find the header, and think it can
    use zlib, and will use it in subsequent tests, but it'll try and link
    64-bit test programs with the 32-bit library, causing those tests to
    falsely fail.  Hilarity ensues.

    Don't check for inflatePrime() on Windows.
    
    On Windows, we build libz as part of the Wireshark build process, so we
    don't necessarily *have* a libz library to search or inflatePrime() at
    this point; the search fails on the buildbots, for example.
    
    So, on Windows, we just assume we have a new enough version of libz, so
    that it has inflatePrime().

    QFont::toString returned the default font (which might be unavailable),
    leading to use of non-monospace fonts in the bytes view. Detect the

    Add additional logic to invoke font detection when the configured font

    export-smb2-objects: Make sure tap be called for named pipe
    
    smb2_eo_tap is not called when smb2 packets are dissected as
    named pipe then exit. Basically, for the following code snippet,
    
    if (length) {
            int old_offset = offset;
            ...
            offset = dissect_file_data_smb2_pipe(...);
            if (offset != oldoffset) {
                    /* managed to dissect pipe data */
                    return offset;
            ...
    
    dissect_file_data_smb2_pipe() always returns a different offset,
    thus it will never hit the smb2_eo_tap related code below that
    are needed for exporting smb2 objects.
    
    As a quick fix, call the tap related code before returning.

    wsmp: read the message length as big endian
    
    We add the message length to the tree as big endian but we interpret it
    as little endian for our further calculations. This causes parsing
    errors. Use big endian for both cases.

    When reviewing the code, the following issues were identified:
    - otid/dtid on 3 bytes were not stored
    - when receiving the first continue from dest, the TC_END hash entry was
    created with the source tid / address instead of destination ones
    - when receiving the first continue from src, the logic could prevent
    the creation of the hash entry
