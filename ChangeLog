    Wiretap: Write commview files with valid headers
    
    When writing a capture as a commview file the header written is two
    bytes longer than the specification. Even though we count 24, we
    actually write 26. This makes the commview file corrupt, as is apparent
    when reading such file, eg., after using Save As... with this format.
    
    Replace writing 2 bytes for the last two fields in the header by 1 byte
    each, as per the header specification.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Sep 2 16:09:24 2019 -0700

    What we're testing for is byte-swappedness, not raw endianness.
    
    On a big-endian machine, if the upper 16 bits of the length are non-zero
    and the lower 16 bits are zero, that means that the length is
    *little*-endian.
    
    What we really care about is whether the file is in the reading host's
    native format, so we can just fetch integral values without swapping, or
    not in that format, in which case we have to byte-swap integral values.
    
    Rename the variable and redo the code to match.
    
    (This may have caused the PacketLogger reader to fail on big-endian
    machines.)

    NFS: Fix hash table key memory corruption
    
    When the same (as determined by key_equal_func) key gets added to the
    GHashTable, old value gets freed and replaced with the new one. This is
    fine for hash tables where the key validity is not tightly coupled to
    the actual data.
    
    In the nfs_name_snoop_matched hash table the key becomes invalid once
    the value gets destroyed (because it shares the data pointed to by fh,
    which gets freed once the value is destroyed).
    
    A problematic capture includes packets such that the matching fh gets
    added twice to the nfs_name_snoop_matched hash table. Prior to this
    change the hash table would end up in a state where the new value is
    associated with the old key (which contains pointer to already freed
    memory). According to the nfs_name_snoop_matched_equal(), the old key
    was equal to the key intended for new value *at the time* of insertion.
    
    This change fixes the bug by using g_hash_table_replace() which does
    update the key in case it already exists in the GHashTable.

    (This also adds some bits not supported by 2.6.x but supported by 3.0.x
    and later, just to indicate that they're already in use as well.)
