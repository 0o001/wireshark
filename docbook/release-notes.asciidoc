usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
