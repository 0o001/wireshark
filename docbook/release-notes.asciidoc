Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found

files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use About→Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
