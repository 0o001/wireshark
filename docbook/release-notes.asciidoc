compiler via the `net.core.bpf_jit_enable` sysctl. This could make
systems more vulnerable to Spectre variant 1 (cve-idlink:2017-5753[])
and this feature has been removed (ws-buglink:14313[]).

usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]

from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
