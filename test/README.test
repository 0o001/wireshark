Wireshark Tests

The main testing script is `test.py`. It will attempt to test as much as
possible by default, including packet capture. This means that you will
probably either have to supply a capture interface (`--capture-interface
<interface>`) or disable capture tests (`--disable-capture`).

To run all tests from CMake do the following:
- Pass `-DTEST_EXTRA_ARGS=--disable-capture` or
  `-DTEST_EXTRA_ARGS=--capture-interface=<interface>`
  as needed for your system.
- Build the “test” target or run ctest, e.g. `ctest --jobs=4 --verbose`.

To run all tests directly, run `test.py -p
/path/to/wireshark-build/run-directory <capture args>`.

To see a list of all options, run `test.py -h` or `test.py --help`.

To see a list of all tests, run `test.py -l`.

See the “Wireshark Tests” chapter of the Developer's Guide for details.
