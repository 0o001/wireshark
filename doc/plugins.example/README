This is an example of how to build a Wireshark plugin out-of-tree.

Tested on Linux using GCC 7. Note this builds against Wireshark's *installed*
version. You should of course adapt to your own needs.

To build/install the plugin (assuming wireshark was installed in /usr/local):

$ PREFIX=/usr/local
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PREFIX/lib64/pkgconfig" cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$PREFIX" .. # Use -DSYSTEM_INSTALLATION=Off to install as single-user
$ make
$ sudo make install
