  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark
   packages. You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using
   the package management system specific to that platform. A list
   of third-party packages can be found on the [3]download page on
   the Wireshark web site.

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for

   These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
   About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.
