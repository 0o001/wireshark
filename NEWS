Wireshark 1.4.0rc2 Release Notes

   ------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Wireshark?

   Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer.
   It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and
   education.

What's New

  Bug Fixes

   The following bugs have been fixed:

     o Update time display in background. (Bug 1275)

     o Wireshark is unresponsive when capturing from named pipes on
       Windows. (Bug 1759)

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since version 1.2:

     o The packet list internals have been rewritten and are now more
       efficient.

     o Columns are easier to use. You can add a protocol field as a
       column by right-clicking on its packet detail item, and you
       can adjust some column preferences by right-clicking the
       column header.

     o Preliminary Python scripting support has been added.

     o Many memory leaks have been fixed.

     o Wireshark 1.4 does not support Windows 2000. Please use
       Wireshark 1.2 or 1.0 on those systems.

     o Packets can now be ignored (excluded from dissection), similar
       to the way they can be marked.

     o Manual IP address resolution is now supported.

     o Columns with seconds can now be displayed as hours, minutes
       and seconds.

     o You can now set the capture buffer size on UNIX and Linux if
       you have libpcap 1.0.0 or greater.

     o TShark no longer needs elevated privileges on UNIX or Linux to
       list interfaces. Only dumpcap requires privileges now.

     o Wireshark and TShark can enable 802.11 monitor mode directly
       if you have libpcap 1.0.0 or greater.

     o You can play RTP streams directly from the RTP Analysis
       window.

     o Capinfos and editcap now respectively support time order
       checking and forcing.

     o Wireshark now has a "jump to timestamp" command-line option.

     o You can open JPEG files directly in Wireshark.

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   http://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
   You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package
   management system specific to that platform. A list of third-party
   packages can be found on the download page on the Wireshark web
   site.

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
   preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
   These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
   About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.
