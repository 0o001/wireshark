       331)

     o Trying to save flow data may crash Wireshark. ([14]Bug 396)

     o It may not be possible to re-order coloring rules under
       Windows. ([15]Bug 699)

     o Printing each packet to a new page didn't work under Windows.
       ([16]Bug 707)

     o The personal hosts configuration file wasn't being parsed
       correctly. ([17]Bug 795)

     o "Save as" to an existing file wasn't allowed. ([18]Bug 927)

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since the last release:

     o [23]AirPcap, support (which provides raw mode capture under
       Windows) has been enhanced to allow capturing on multiple
       AirPcap adapters simultaneously using the Multi-Channel
       Aggregator.

     o VoIP call playback has been enhanced. If Wireshark is linked
       with the PortAudio library, you can play back G.711
       conversations. This feature is present in the standard Windows
       installer.

     o The capture interface dialog display has been enhanced.

     o The "Save" button has been removed from the "Ok" / "Apply" /
       "Cancel" button group in the following dialogs:

          o Edit/Preferences

          o View/Coloring Rules

          o Capture/Capture Filters

          o Analyze/Display Filters

          o Analyze/Enabled Protocols

       If you're fond of the "Save" button it can be resurrected in
       the User Interface preferences.

     o Reading from stdin ("-i -") now works under Windows.

     o Expert analysis has been improved.

     o Wireshark now supports USB as a media type. If you're running
       a Linux distribution with version 2.6.11 of the kernel or
       greater and you have the usbmon module enabled and you have a
       recent CVS version of libpcap (post-0.9.5) installed you can
       also do live captures. More details can be found at the
       [24]USB capture setup page on the wiki.

     o The number of WEP keys that the user can specify in the IEEE
       802.11 protocol preferences has been increased from 4 to 64.

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   the [25]download page on the main web site.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
   You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package
   management system specific to that platform. A list of third-party
   packages can be found on the [26]download page on the Wireshark
   web site.

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
   preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
   These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
   About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.

Known Problems

   On Windows systems the packet list scroll bar can sometimes
   disappear or become unusable. Until the problem is fixed you can
   work around it by resizing the packet list or the main window.
   ([27]Bug 220)

   The Filter button is nonfunctional in the file dialogs under
   Windows. ([28]Bug 942)

Getting Help

   Community support is available on the wireshark-users mailing
   list. Subscription information and archives for all of Wireshark's
   mailing lists can be found on [29]the web site.

   Commercial support, training, and development services are
   available from [30]CACE Technologies.
