       with Linux and macOS and improves compatibility on non-English
       systems. (Bug 15118[3])

 Getting Wireshark

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You

   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can
   be found on the download page[5] on the Wireshark web site.

 File Locations

  Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These
  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use About→Folders to
  find the default locations on your system.
