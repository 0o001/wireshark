       IPv4 address.

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since the last release:

     o Most of the capture code has been moved out of the GUI, which
       means that Wireshark no longer needs to be run as root.

     o Many display filter names have been cleaned up. If your
       favorite display filter just went missing, please consult the
       [2]display filter reference to find out where it ended up.

     o You can now filter directly on SNMP OIDs.

     o IO graphs have more display options, and you can now export
       graphs.

     o You can now follow UDP streams in addition to TCP and SSL
       streams.

     o You can now disable coloring rules without deleting them.

     o Main window toolbar buttons are now available even when the
       window is small.

     o The version of WinPcap that ships with the Windows installers
       has been updated to 4.0.2.

     o The Windows installers now include a "services" file, which
       maps port numbers to names.

     o The Windows installer now enables npf.sys by default under
       Vista. Wireshark will print a warning at startup if npf.sys
       isn't loaded under Vista.

     o Optimizations have been applied in some places to make
       Wireshark start up and run faster.

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   the [3]download page on the main web site.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
   You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package
   management system specific to that platform. A list of third-party
   packages can be found on the [4]download page on the Wireshark web
   site.

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
   preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
   These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
   About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.

Known Problems

   Saving to the currently-open file doesn't work under Windows.
   ([5]Bug 2080)

   The Filter button is nonfunctional in the file dialogs under
   Windows. ([6]Bug 942)

   GTK+ 2.x [7]renders white text on 8-bit displays under Windows.
   You can work around this by installing the GTK+ 1.2 version of
   Wireshark or by increasing your display depth to 15 bits or more.

Getting Help

   Community support is available on the wireshark-users mailing
   list. Subscription information and archives for all of Wireshark's
   mailing lists can be found on [8]the web site.

   Commercial support, training, and development services are
   available from [9]CACE Technologies.
