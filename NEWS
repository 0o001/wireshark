Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   the [2]download page on the main web site.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package
   management system specific to that platform. A list of third-party
   packages can be found on the [3]download page on the Wireshark web
   site.

File Locations

   preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
   These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
   About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.
