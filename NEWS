Wireshark 1.6.0 Release Notes

   ------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Wireshark?

   Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer.
   It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and
   education.

What's New

  Bug Fixes

   The following bugs have been fixed:

     o Wireshark is unresponsive when capturing from named pipes on
       Windows. (Bug 1759)

     o Crash when sorting column while capturing. (Bug 4273)

     o Ring buffers are no longer turned on by default when using
       multiple capture files.

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since version 1.4:

     o Wireshark is now distributed as an installation package rather
       than a drag-installer on OS X. The installer adds a startup
       item that should make it easier to capture packets.

     o Large file (greater than 2 GB) support has been improved.

     o Wireshark and TShark can import text dumps, similar to
       text2pcap.

     o You can now view Wireshark's dissector tables (for example the
       TCP port to dissector mappings) from the main window.

     o Wireshark can export SSL session keys via File→Export→SSL
       Session Keys...

     o TShark can show a specific occurrence of a field when using
       '-T fields'.

     o Custom columns can show a specific occurrence of a field.

     o You can hide columns in the packet list.

     o Wireshark can now export SMB objects.

     o dftest and randpkt now have manual pages.

     o TShark can now display iSCSI, ICMP and ICMPv6 service response
       times.

     o Dumpcap can now save files with a user-specified group id.

     o Syntax checking is done for capture filters.

     o You can display the compiled BPF code for capture filters in
       the Capture Options dialog.

     o You can now navigate backwards and forwards through TCP and
       UDP sessions using Ctrl+, and Ctrl+. .

     o Packet length is (finally) a default column.

     o TCP window size is now avaiable both scaled and unscaled. A
       TCP window scaling graph is available in the GUI.

     o 802.1q VLAN tags are now shown in the Ethernet II protocol
       tree instead of a separate tree.

     o Various dissectors now display some UTF-16 strings as proper
       Unicode including the DCE/RPC and SMB dissectors.

     o The RTP player now has an option to show the time of day in
       the graph in addition to the seconds since beginning of
       capture.

     o The RTP player now shows why media interruptions occur.

     o Graphs now save as PNG images by default.

     o TShark can read and write host name information from and to
       pcapng-formatted files. Wireshark can read it. TShark can dump
       host name information via

       [-z hosts]

       .

     o TShark's -z option now uses the

       [-z <proto>,srt]

       syntax instead of

       [-z <proto>,rtt]

       for all protocols that support service response time
       statistics. This matches Wireshark's syntax for this option.

     o Wireshark and TShark can now read compressed Windows Sniffer
       files.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
   You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package
   management system specific to that platform. A list of third-party
   packages can be found on the download page on the Wireshark web
   site.

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
