Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark
   packages. You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using
   the package management system specific to that platform. A list
   of third-party packages can be found on the [3]download page on
   the Wireshark web site.

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
   preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
   These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
   About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.
