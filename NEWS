What is Wireshark?

   Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
   used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

What's New

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 2.2.0:
     * Experimental 32-bit and 64-bit Windows Installer (.msi) packages
       are available. It is recommended that you use these independently
       of the NSIS (.exe) installers. That is, you should make sure the
       NSIS package is completely uninstalled before installing the
       Windows Installer package and vice-versa.
     * Source packages are now compressed using xz instead of bzip2.
     * The legacy (GTK+) UI is disabled by default in the Windows
       installers.
     * The legacy (GTK+) UI is disabled by default in the development
       environment (Autotools and CMake).
     * SS7 Point Codes can now be resolved into names with a hosts-like
       file.
     * Wireshark can now go fullscreen to have more room for packets.
     * TShark can now export objects like the other GUI interfaces.
     * Support for G.722 and G.726 codecs in the RTP Player (via the
       SpanDSP library).
     * You can now choose the output device when playing RTP streams.
     * Added support for dissectors to include a unit name natively in
       their hf field. A field can now automatically append "seconds" or
       "ms" to its value without additional printf-style APIs.
     * The Default profile can now be reset to default values.
     * You can move back and forth in the selection history in the Qt UI.
     * IEEE 802.15.4 dissector now uses an UAT for decryption keys. The
       original decryption key preference has been obsoleted.
     * Extcap utilities can now provide configuration for a GUI interface
       toolbar to control the extcap utility while capturing.
     * Extcap utilities can now validate the capture filter.
     * Display filter function len() can now be used on all string and
       byte fields.
     * Added an experimental timeline view for 802.11 wireless packet data
       which can be enabled via the "802.11 radio information"
       preferences.
     * Added TLS 1.3 (draft 21) dissection and decryption support ([1]Bug
       12779).
     * The (D)TLS Application Layer protocol (e.g. HTTP or CoAP) can now
       be changed via the Decode As dialog.
     * The RSA keys dialog for SSL keys has improved feedback for invalid
       settings and no longer requires the IP address, Port or Protocol
       fields to be set in addition to the Key File.
     * TCP Analysis will detect and flag more spurious retransmissions.

Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   [2]https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be
   found on the [3]download page on the Wireshark web site.
     __________________________________________________________________

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
   files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations
   vary from platform to platform. You can use About->Folders to find the
   default locations on your system.
