What is Wireshark?

   Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer.
   It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development, and
   education.

What's New

  Bug Fixes

   The following vulnerabilities have been fixed:

     o The GSM BSSMAP dissector could crash. Versions affected:
       0.10.11.

   Ilja van Sprundel discovered the following vulnerabilities:

     o The ANSI MAP dissector was vulnerable to a format string
       overflow. Versions affected: 0.10.0.

     o The Checkpoint FW-1 dissector was vulnerable to a format
       string overflow. Versions affected: 0.10.10.

     o The MQ dissector was vulnerable to a format string overflow.
       Versions affected: 0.10.4.

     o The XML dissector was vulnerable to a format string overflow.
       Versions affected: 0.10.13.

     o The MOUNT dissector could attempt to allocate large amounts of
       memory. Versions affected: 0.9.4.

     o The NCP NMAS and NDPS dissectors were susceptible to
       off-by-one errors. Versions affected: 0.9.7.

     o The NTP dissector was vulnerable to a format string overflow.
       Versions affected: 0.10.13.

     o The SSH dissector was vulnerable to an infinite loop. Versions
       affected: 0.9.10.

     o The NFS dissector may have been susceptible to a buffer
       overflow. Versions affected: 0.8.16.

   Ilja found several other problems that could result in
   mis-dissected packets. They have been fixed.

   The following non-security-related bugs have been fixed:

     o The "Follow TCP Stream" dialog now wraps long lines.

     o Wireshark no longer aborts under Windows 95, 98, or ME.

  Warning

       Windows 95, 98, and ME do not support memory protection
       features that are required in order to run Wireshark securely.
       It is strongly recommended that you not run Wireshark on these
       platforms.

     o File exports under Windows work again.

     o Problems with ring buffers under 0.99.0 have been fixed.

     o It was possible for Wireshark to crash when closing the
       capture information dialog. This has been fixed.

     o It was possible for Wireshark to crash when using the "Find"
       feature. This has been fixed.

     o Wireshark could crash if an interface was removed while
       viewing the interface list. This has been fixed.

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since the last release:

     o Multicast stream analysis (Statistics->Multicast Streams) has
       been added. It lets you determine burst size, output buffer
       size, and losses for multicast data.

     o TCP reassembly has been updated and improved.

     o Expert analysis has been updated and improved.

     o SCSI service response time statistics have been added.

     o You can now find next/previous marked frames.

     o The LDAP and SNMP dissectors have been completely rewriten.

     o The SMB dissector now tracks filenames and share names.

     o The Windows file dialogs have been improved.

     o If Wireshark is linked with the PortAudio library, you can now
       listen to RTP streams. (PortAudio didn't make the cut in the
       current Windows installer. It will be included with 0.99.3.)

Getting Wireshark

  Microsoft Windows

   Download wireshark-setup-0.99.2.exe from the [1]Windows download
   area on the main web site. Double-click the installer executable.

  Sun Solaris

   Download the appropriate package from the [2]Solaris download area
   on the main web site. Uncompress the package using bzip2, and
   install it using pkgadd.

  Source Code

   Download wireshark-0.99.2.tar.gz from the [3]main download area on
   the web site. Extract the package using tar and gzip. Run
   "configure ; make ; make install".

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
   You can install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages
   can be found on the [4]download page on the Wireshark web site.

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
   preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
   These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
   About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.

Known Problems

   On Windows systems the packet list scroll bar can sometimes
   disappear or become unusable. Until the problem is fixed you can
   work around it by resizing the packet list or the main window.
   ([5]Bug #220)

   The Filter button is nonfunctional in the file dialogs under
   Windows.

   Trying to save flow data may crash Wireshark. ([6]Bug #396)

   It may not be possible to re-order coloring rules under Windows.
   ([7]Bug #699)
