Getting Wireshark

   You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package
   management system specific to that platform. A list of third-party
   packages can be found on the download page on the Wireshark web
   site.

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for

   These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
   About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.

Known Problems

   Dumpcap might not quit if Wireshark or TShark crashes. (Bug 1419)
