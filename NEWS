Getting Wireshark

   Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
   the download page on the main web site.

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
   You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package
   management system specific to that platform. A list of third-party
   packages can be found on the download page on the Wireshark web
   site.

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
   preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
   These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
   About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.

Known Problems

   Wireshark may appear offscreen on multi-monitor Windows systems.
   (Bug 553)

   Wireshark might make your system disassociate from a wireless
   network on OS X. (Bug 1315)

   Dumpcap might not quit if Wireshark or TShark crashes. (Bug 1419)

   The BER dissector might infinitely loop. (Bug 1516)

   won't show up in the packet list. (Bug 1605)

   Capture filters aren't applied when capturing from named pipes.
   (Bug 1814)
